Inflation continues to decline gradually in most economies. Higher policy interest rates and tight financial conditions are contributing to slowing global demand growth and easing price pressures, although inflation in services prices is sticky. 

Global economic growth is slowing. While the US economy has been surprisingly robust, the weakness in China has been more pronounced than expected in the July Report. 

In Canada, higher interest rates are working to ease price pressures, and consumer price index (CPI) inflation has come down significantly from its peak in June 2022. However, progress toward the 2% target is proving to be slow, and the pace of future declines in inflation remains uncertain. Core inflation has been more persistent than expected. 

At the same time, demand growth has eased and supply is rising. Evidence suggests that the economy is approaching balance. With supply growing faster than demand, price pressures are expected to gradually moderate further.

Economic activity is forecast to be modest through most of 2024, with annual growth in gross domestic product (GDP) just under 1%. As past interest rate increases continue to work their way through the economy, they will weigh on household spending and business investment. Weak foreign demand is also expected to slow export growth. GDP growth is projected to rise to about 2½% in 2025.

Inflation is now projected to stay around 3½% until the middle of 2024. As the economy moves into excess supply and price pressures moderate, inflation is forecast to ease to about 2½% in the second half of 2024 and then return to target in 2025. 

A considerable amount of uncertainty surrounds the forecast. Three-month rates of core inflation have remained elevated, in the range of 3½% to 4% for the past year. Near-term inflation expectations are still high, and there is a risk that they could become a driver of wage- and price-setting behaviour. Another risk is that the war in Israel and Gaza spreads further into a broader regional conflict, disrupting oil supplies and leading to a resurgence of inflation in energy prices. 

Overall, there is more evidence that the economy is slowing, which is relieving price pressures. But the progress to price stability is slow, and inflationary risks have increased.
	
Inflation is easing across most economies. Initially, this largely reflected falling energy prices. More recently, the decline in inflation in advanced economies has been led by slower growth in the prices of non-energy goods and shelter. Inflation in the prices of services remains elevated and is taking longer to adjust. Inflation is anticipated to continue its gradual decline as higher policy interest rates and the recent increases in yields on long-term bonds slow demand. However, higher oil prices are slowing the disinflationary process and increasing upside risks. Inflation in most major advanced economies is now expected to return to central bank targets in 2025, although the timing remains uncertain.  

As projected in the July Report, global growth has been slowing and is forecast to ease further. The composition of global growth, however, has shifted. For 2023, economic growth in the United States—Canada’s largest trading partner—is now expected to be stronger than previously anticipated, while growth for China has been revised down. 

Shelter price inflation, though generally still high, is now declining in most advanced economies. This is expected to reduce overall inflation, but the extent of the impact will likely vary across countries. This variation is partly due to differences in how national price indexes measure housing costs. In the United States, shelter costs are expected to be a significant driver of falling inflation in 2024 because rent is not rising as sharply as before.
	
Global financial conditions have tightened since the July Report. Most notably, yields on long-term bonds have seen a sharp rise. A number of factors could explain why yields have risen, and separating out their contributions is difficult. First, real yields have increased, due in part to market expectations that policy rates will remain higher for longer. Second, the term premium has risen, reflecting increased market uncertainty about how high policy interest rates may rise and how long they may remain elevated. Third, factors such as the large fiscal deficit in the United States and high issuance of government debt globally, amid soft demand for such assets, may also be playing a role. Finally, the rise in long-term interest rates may reflect the market’s reassessment of the neutral rate of interest. The Canadian dollar has been broadly stable against the US dollar this year, although it has appreciated against a basket of other currencies.

The US economy has grown robustly since mid-2022. Consumption has been supported by strong employment growth and households spending their savings accumulated during the COVID-19 pandemic. Strong consumer demand and an easing of supply constraints have boosted investment. Growth is expected to decelerate over the coming quarters and remain weak in 2024. This is largely due to the impact of past interest rate increases and the recent tightening of overall financial conditions. Growth is projected to pick up in 2025 as the impact of past monetary policy tightening eases. 

In contrast, growth in China slowed sharply in the second quarter of 2023 after the strong reopening effects observed in the first quarter dissipated. More recently, problems in China’s property sector have intensified anew, leading to increased uncertainty and subdued sentiment. Foreign demand for China’s exports is also growing at a slower pace, and export prices have been falling.
 
In the euro area, growth remains sluggish. Recent data point to a slowdown in the second half of this year as the impact of past interest rate increases and the tightening in financial conditions restrain growth. Growth is projected to pick up gradually over 2024 and 2025 as the effects of past energy shocks and monetary tightening fade.

Global oil prices have fluctuated around a higher level than assumed in the July Report. Prices rose sharply after Saudi Arabia and Russia cut oil production and exports. Subsequently, the war in Israel and Gaza has led to fresh concerns about oil supplies. The per-barrel price of Brent oil is assumed to be US$90 throughout the projection, which is US$10 higher than assumed in the July Report.

Non-energy commodity prices are modestly lower than assumed in the July Report. The decline primarily reflects agricultural prices, which have broadly fallen because favourable weather has improved harvest forecasts. Lumber prices have also declined because weak housing activity across North America is weighing on demand. 

CPI inflation has dropped significantly from its peak of 8.1% in June 2022. More recently, it has fluctuated between 2.8% and 4.0%. Although price pressures are easing for some goods and services, core inflation is proving to be more stubborn than anticipated. 

Past interest rate increases are working through the economy, slowing demand and gradually reducing price pressures. Inflation expectations have eased, but they continue to be above the Bank’s forecast for inflation. Moreover, businesses are still able to easily pass on cost increases, and wage growth remains strong. As a result, progress toward the inflation target has been slow. Inflation is still expected to ease steadily, but uncertainty about the pace toward the 2% target remains elevated. 

Growing evidence shows that past interest rate increases are working to bring demand and supply back into balance. GDP growth has averaged 1% over the past year, lower than the rate of potential output growth. Economic activity was flat in the second quarter of 2023, with some of this weakness due to temporary factors such as wildfires and the strikes in the public sector. 

Higher interest rates have contributed to softening demand for housing and many durable goods as well as slowing household credit growth. Demand growth has also moderated for many services, such as recreation, restaurants and accommodation. Overall, per capita GDP growth has been negative, falling by 1.6% over the past year. 

As interest rates have increased, measures of household financial stress have risen from the lows observed during the height of the pandemic. To date, indicators of financial stress point mainly to non-mortgage holders. For example, although delinquency rates for mortgage products have remained close to their all-time lows, the share of borrowers falling behind on payments by 60 days or more has continued to increase for most credit products. In particular, delinquency rates for motor vehicle loans have surpassed pre-pandemic levels. 

With slowing demand growth and rising supply, a variety of indicators suggest that the economy is approaching balance.

Excess demand pressures have been easing. The output gap is now estimated to be between ‑0.75% and 0.25% in the third quarter of 2023. As is typical at this point in the business cycle, there are mixed signals about the balance of supply and demand. Moreover, the recovery from the pandemic shock makes it harder than usual to assess the level of excess demand in the economy, so uncertainty is greater than normal.

In the labour market, job gains slowed to an average of around 32,000 per month in the third quarter, below the pace consistent with labour force growth. The Bank’s business surveys also suggest that the economy is moving closer to balance. Businesses have seen indicators of capacity pressures fall from high levels, and their hiring and investment plans have been trending down. In the Business Outlook Survey (BOS) for the third quarter of 2023, the share of businesses reporting binding labour shortages has returned close to its historical average. 

Other labour market indicators, however, point to modest excess demand. While job vacancies have eased significantly over the past year, they have not yet returned to pre-pandemic levels. The unemployment rate has risen in recent months but remains low. Consistent with a tight labour market, wage pressures are elevated and reports of shortages of skilled workers are widespread.

CPI inflation in Canada declined from a peak of 8.1% in 2022 and has been volatile in recent months, ranging from 2.8% to 4.0%. Initially, the decline was due to falling energy prices and improvements in global supply chains. More recently, higher interest rates have led to a better balance between supply and demand. The impact on inflation is materializing, albeit more slowly than expected. 

In recent months, higher oil prices have boosted energy price inflation, especially for gasoline. Shelter price inflation has also picked up, with a three-month rate of 8.0%. It has also become more broad-based, with rent and other accommodation expenses increasing in addition to the ongoing rise in mortgage interest costs. In previous cycles, when the contribution from mortgage interest costs has gone up, the impact on shelter inflation has been mitigated by lower inflation in house price–related components. However, recently, structural supply challenges have limited this offset and put upward pressure on other shelter components.

At the same time, progress toward lower inflation continues for other subcomponents of the CPI. Three-month inflation for food purchased from stores has fallen to 3.9%, and growth in input costs has eased. Inflation for goods excluding energy and food from stores has also moderated because demand for these goods has diminished. Likewise, inflation for services 
excluding shelter has declined as the economy has slowed. Moreover, while larger-than-normal price increases remain widespread across goods and services, the breadth has narrowed considerably.

Some of the subcomponents of the CPI show indications of improvement, but overall progress toward lower inflation has been slower than anticipated.

Core inflation has not declined as much as expected. It has made little progress after falling on a year-over-year basis from just over 5% in 2022 to just under 4% in mid-2023. This is consistent with the three-month rates.
	
CPI-trim and CPI-median have hovered mostly in the 3½% to 4% range over the past year. 
	
Alternative measures of core inflation—such as CPI excluding food and energy and CPIX, which excludes eight of the most volatile components—have eased slightly but have shown more volatility.

As excess demand eases, inflation is expected to slow. At the same time, inflation expectations should also fall, businesses’ pricing behaviour should normalize, and wage growth should moderate. So far, progress has occurred but somewhat more slowly than anticipated. Many indicators remain elevated or have yet to normalize.

Near-term inflation expectations have eased, but they remain elevated and above the Bank’s inflation forecast. Results from the BOS for the third quarter of 2023 show that businesses expect the annual rate of inflation to average between 3% and 3.5% over the next two years. Consumers’ inflation expectations also remain higher than they were before the pandemic, averaging 5% over the next year and 4% for the year beyond that.2 Long-term expectations remain consistent with the 2% target.

Corporate pricing behaviour has yet to normalize. Businesses continue to increase prices more frequently and by a larger amount than normal. This may indicate that households and businesses are, respectively, expecting to pay more and charge more for goods and services. High inflation expectations could also feed into wages. 

Economic growth is expected to remain muted, averaging less than 1.0% over the next several quarters. The effects of past increases in interest rates and, more recently, tighter global financial conditions are expected to continue to weigh on consumption and business investment spending. Results from the BOS for the third quarter point to weakening sales growth in the next year, particularly for those businesses that are the most sensitive to interest rates. In addition, slowing foreign demand is anticipated to dampen Canadian export growth over this period. However, spending by government contributes materially to growth, averaging 2.5% through 2024, somewhat above potential output growth.

With demand continuing to grow more slowly than potential output, the economy is projected to move into modest excess supply in the fourth quarter of 2023, and excess supply increases through most of 2024.

GDP growth is expected to pick up at the end of 2024, rising to around 2.5% in 2025 and this begins to reduce excess supply in the economy. Household spending on a per capita basis is weak in 2024. It then strengthens as the effects of monetary policy tightening on growth fades. Exports and business investment are supported by the recovery in foreign 
demand. 

Potential output growth is estimated to average about 2% over the projection horizon. This estimate reflects solid population growth due to strong immigration and the ongoing arrival of large numbers of temporary residents. It also reflects an expected pickup in labour productivity from its current weakness.

Consumer spending is expected to be subdued through 2024. While consumption is supported by strong population growth, on a per capita basis it is projected to continue declining through most of 2024. Responses to the Canadian Survey of Consumer Expectations for the third quarter of 2023 indicate that households are cutting back on their spending, delaying purchases and shifting their savings to higher-rate accounts in response to the ongoing effects of higher interest rates and the rising cost of living. Income growth is also projected to slow as the labour market eases further, weighing on the growth in consumption spending.

In contrast, residential investment is expected to start recovering in late 2023 from its recent lows as the boost to construction from strong demand outweighs the waning effects of higher interest rates. 

Business investment is expected to remain weak for the rest of 2023 before picking up gradually in 2024. Investment is being held back by elevated borrowing costs, tight credit conditions, the prospect of slowing economic activity and the winding down of large infrastructure projects. It begins to pick up in the second half of 2024 as demand improves and the drag from higher interest rates fades.

After a strong start to 2023, export growth is expected to stall over the rest of 2023 and 2024 due to softening foreign demand for non-commodity exports. Exports are anticipated to pick up in 2025, with the recovery in foreign demand and increased energy transportation capacity following the completion of the Trans Mountain Pipeline Expansion project. 

Growth in imports is projected to remain modest through the first half of 2024. It is expected to pick up over the second half of 2024 and 2025 due to strengthening domestic demand.

CPI inflation is projected to remain persistently high, at roughly 3½%, until the middle of 2024. Energy prices no longer pull inflation down and instead add some upward pressure. Shelter price inflation will continue to be elevated because of higher mortgage interest costs, rent and other housing costs. The strength in rent and other housing costs is partly due to strong housing demand, which is supported by rapid population growth, and a structural lack of housing supply. Unlike in previous cycles, rising mortgage interest costs are not mitigated significantly by weakness in other shelter components.

These upward pressures on inflation are anticipated to be partially offset by the easing of excess demand, weaker pressure from input costs and further disinflation in globally traded goods. 

Slower growth in input costs is expected to result in further easing in food price inflation. The three-month rate for food price inflation has slowed and is well below the latest year over-year number. This is a signal that food price inflation will likely ease further in the coming months. 

Inflation is projected to fall to around 2.5% in the second half of 2024. It then continues to decline, returning to the 2% target in 2025. Although shelter prices add upward pressure on inflation over the projection horizon, shelter price inflation is expected to slow from its current pace. Ongoing excess supply in the economy moderates price inflation, helps ease 
inflation expectations and encourages businesses to gradually return to more normal pricing behaviour.

As in the July Report, the outlook in the base-case scenario is the most likely outcome for inflation. Although the Bank sees both upside and downside risks to this outlook, with inflation above target for two years and expected to stay slightly above 3% for an additional year, the Bank is more concerned about upside risks to inflation. Moreover, with progress toward the 2% target slow and increased global risks of higher inflation, the risk that disinflation could stall or that inflation even could rise again has increased. 

As noted in past reports, several upside risks to inflation exist. The inflation expectations of households and businesses remain elevated. If these expectations do not decline as anticipated, inflation is likely to remain higher than in the base case. Furthermore, businesses may be slower to adjust their pricing behaviour. In addition, if the labour market remains tight or if productivity growth remains weak, cost pressures could be higher and more persistent than projected. Other risks, such as a growing number of extreme weather events affecting harvests and supply chains, could also put upward pressure on inflation.

Some risks have increased since the July Report. Notably, oil prices are higher than expected. So far, the war in Israel and Gaza has not impacted the supply of oil. However, if it were to spread further into a broader regional conflict, global oil supplies could be disrupted and oil prices would rise. Price increases could be amplified because current global inventories of oil are low. If such a rise in oil prices materializes and is sustained, pass-through to other prices may occur. Inflation could climb sharply, particularly in a context in which businesses change prices frequently. Heightened geopolitical uncertainties may also create new cost pressures by affecting the global supply chains for goods and raw materials.

A faster-than-expected slowdown in the Canadian economy is the main downside risk to inflation. Such a slowing could occur through two main channels. 

First, the effects of monetary policy could be larger than what is in the base case. With record-high levels of household debt, Canadians could cut back consumption spending more than projected. Lower house prices could exacerbate this decline. Business activities such as investment and hiring could also slow by more than the Bank expects. 
	
Second, global activity could be weaker than in the base case. Monetary policy is tight in most advanced economies, and bond yields have risen sharply in recent weeks, reaching levels not seen since before the 2008–09 global financial crisis. If the increase in yields proves to be larger or more persistent than expected, equity and other asset prices could be negatively impacted further. This, in turn, would weigh on investment and consumption both abroad and in Canada. Moreover, previous episodes of monetary policy tightening have occasionally triggered market volatility and capital outflows from vulnerable and highly indebted countries, leading to sharp slowdowns in global growth. Weaker global demand could reduce prices for commodities and tradable goods. 

Canadian economic growth and inflation would be pulled down if these risks were to materialize.
