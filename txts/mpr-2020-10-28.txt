The Canadian and world economies have rebounded sharply from the severe downturns experienced with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the virus continues to spread worldwide, and it is still having significant economic impacts. This is particularly the case in sectors that rely on individuals being physically close to each other, such as hospitality and travel. Looking forward, the course of the pandemic and the steps needed to contain it remain highly uncertain.
	
Following the sharp bounce back in growth that occurred when contain­ment measures were lifted and the economy reopened, the Canadian economy transitioned to a slower, more protracted recuperation phase of its recovery. The phases of the recovery are proceeding largely as described in the July Report, though the initial rebound was stronger than expected. Furthermore, the near-term slowing in the recuperation phase is likely to be more pronounced as a result of the recent increase of COVID-19 infections.
	
There is ongoing and significant slack in the Canadian economy. The gap between the actual output and the potential output of the economy is not expected to close until 2023. The economy is progressing unevenly, with some sectors and workers disproportionately affected by the virus. 
	
Ongoing slack in the economy is expected to continue to hold inflation down into 2023.  

The economic recovery remains dependent on the evolution of the pandemic. Despite this ongoing uncertainty, the Bank is returning to its usual practice of providing a projection for economic growth and inflation in this Monetary Policy Report. Needless to say, this projection remains highly conditional on the course of the virus and the measures needed to contain it. But, with more than six months since the onset of the pandemic, the Bank has gained a better understanding of how containment measures and support programs affect the Canadian and global economies. This, along with more information on medical developments related to COVID-19, allows the Bank to now make a reasonable set of assumptions to underpin a base-case forecast. 
	
Given the continued uncertainty about the evolution of the pandemic, the projection is highly conditional on the following assumptions.	

Extensive lockdown measures, such as the widespread closures imposed early in the pandemic, will not be reintroduced, although more localized and moderate containment measures will ebb and flow.
	
Vaccines and effective treatments will be widely available by mid-2022, at which time the direct effects of the pandemic on economic activity will have ended. Precautionary behaviour of households and the effects from the uncertainty surrounding COVID-19 are, however, likely to linger.

The pandemic is also likely to have persistent effects on the preferences and behaviours of consumers and businesses. This could lead to lasting changes to the structure of the economy and could weigh on its potential output. The sizes and timing of such effects are difficult to estimate precisely. Given these considerations, the outlook for Canadian and global economic activity remains unusually uncertain.
 
Global economic growth rebounded as economies reopened over the summer, but, as expected, the surge in activity has since slowed. By the third quarter of 2020, the global economy is estimated to have recovered more than half of its initial loss of 10 percent. The reopening stage was more robust and more uneven across regions than in the central scenario presented in the July Report: advanced economies and China experienced milder contractions and stronger rebounds. In contrast, emerging-market economies (EMEs) 
have been hit harder, especially those with severe outbreaks, such as India and some Latin American countries. 

Changes in commodity prices reflect the partial and uneven recovery in the global economy. Initially, global oil prices rebounded quickly, but they remain roughly unchanged since July and are about one-third lower than their pre-pandemic levels. Meanwhile, non-energy commodity price indexes have more than fully recovered. 

Policy plays a key role in the dynamics of the recovery. Income and employment were supported by large fiscal policy measures announced at the onset of the crisis. Now, however, the expiration of fiscal measures will contribute to slowing growth in some economies. 

In the Bank’s projection, global growth slows in the fourth quarter. Several factors are contributing to weaker growth in many countries, including fading pent-up demand, declining fiscal support and rising numbers of COVID-19 cases. During the prolonged recuperation stage of the recovery, physical distancing measures and uncertainty about the virus are expected to create a persistent drag in most economies through 2022, when the virus is assumed to be under control. Global trade has rebounded quickly, reflecting, in part, the resilience of global value chains. The recovery in global goods production and trade should help to limit negative trade spillover 
effects. 

Overall, global gross domestic product (GDP) is projected to contract about 4 percent in 2020 before growing by 4½ percent on average in 2021 and  2022. Global growth in 2020 is stronger than expected in the July Report. After 2020, it is revised down, reflecting weaker outlooks for EMEs and the downward revision to potential output growth in all regions. 

COVID-19 will have lasting effects on the world economy. Global potential output is expected to be about 2 percent lower by the end of 2022 compared with its pre-pandemic trend. Factors contributing to this decline include costly reallocations of resources, reduced labour force attachment, and slower growth in investment and productivity. Persistent excess supply in all regions through 2022 keeps inflation 
pressures subdued.
	
Global financial market conditions remain highly accommodative, as central banks keep policy rates low and use other tools to provide additional stimulus. The US Federal Reserve recently adopted a new flexible average inflation targeting framework and restated its accommodative stance. Yields for sovereign bonds are near record lows, with most sovereign bonds issued by advanced economies trading below 1 percent. Yield curves for North American sovereign bonds have steepened slightly, with long-short spreads 
reaching their early-2018 levels. Yields remain anchored at the short end by central bank policy rate targets and forward guidance. Meanwhile, long-term yields have risen, reflecting that investors’ sentiment has improved and inflation expectations are slightly higher. Market-based expectations for US inflation have increased since July and are mostly back to pre-crisis levels. 

Financing conditions have improved somewhat for non-financial corporations and EMEs since July. Corporate spreads have declined further, and North American corporate bond issuance has been strong, although it has recently slowed. Emerging-market bond spreads are also lower than in July, and capital flows are returning to some emerging markets. North American equity indexes are up from their mid-July levels, although performance varies considerably across sectors, reflecting the unevenness of the recovery. 

The Canadian dollar has strengthened further against the US dollar since July amid increased global appetite for risk. Despite oil prices remaining well below their pre-pandemic levels, the Canadian dollar has returned to the level it was at in late 2019 and early 2020. The US dollar has depreciated since July, partly reflecting further declines in real interest rates in the United States relative to other countries. Because the economies of emerging markets have generally been more negatively affected by the pandemic, their currencies, as a group, continue to weaken relative to those of their trading partners. By contrast, the euro has strengthened since July. 
 
US employment and economic activity rebounded quickly after May and by more than expected in the July Report. In June, consumption of goods surpassed its pre-pandemic levels, with strong demand for home improvement items and motor vehicles. Residential construction has also picked up strongly. In contrast, services consumption has only partially recovered, and industrial production remains below pre-pandemic levels in many sectors.

US fiscal policy has provided important support in 2020. The Bank estimates that fiscal stimulus offset about half of the negative economic effects of the pandemic by the third quarter. US monetary policy has been highly accommodative, and markets expect this to continue over the medium term, consistent with the Federal Reserve’s recent guidance.

Incoming data show gains in employment and economic activity have eased since July, as the initial surge of demand subsided. US growth is anticipated to slow markedly in the fourth quarter as rising numbers of COVID-19 cases are prompting renewed caution and some fiscal support measures are set to expire. The Bank’s projection assumes no additional fiscal measures will be implemented. Consumption growth is therefore expected to be particularly weak in the autumn and winter, with elevated rates of new infections requiring continued physical distancing. Beginning in mid-2021, consumption growth should gradually pick up because the need for these measures will likely ease, although consumers are anticipated to remain apprehensive throughout the projection horizon. The weak consumption outlook and elevated uncertainty slow investment growth. The pandemic is also expected to negatively affect US potential output growth.

Inflation is anticipated to remain below 2 percent through 2022 due to persistent excess supply. In recent months, core inflation has been pushed up by transitory factors, including higher prices for motor vehicles and parts as well as financial services.

The euro area economy contracted most among the major economies, with output in the second quarter falling to 15 percent below its pre-pandemic level. Policy support has preserved jobs effectively despite large declines in activity and hours worked. Indicators of production and sentiment in the euro area suggest that growth in the third quarter rebounded by somewhat more than expected in the July Report. However, the recent resurgence in COVID-19 infections has required some renewed containment measures, slowing near-term growth.

Looking beyond the near term, the recovery is expected to be prolonged, reflecting a persistent need for physical distancing measures. This is somewhat offset by policy support, although fiscal support has been moderate so far and the scope for further monetary policy action may be limited. The pandemic is also expected to reduce labour input and total factor productivity growth, slowing potential and actual output growth in the euro area. 

With the spread of the virus under control there, China’s economic recovery has been faster than that of other major economies and than that expected in July. China’s GDP returned to its pre-pandemic level in the second quarter. Investment in infrastructure and real estate has been especially robust, partly due to policy support and strong credit growth. Exports have also increased rapidly in recent months. Chinese exporters have benefited from an earlier reopening than other economies and from strong foreign demand for medical equipment, office items for remote work and high-tech products. Retail sales have lagged the recovery in production, although recent data suggest consumption and demand for services are gaining momentum.

China’s recovery is expected to broaden further as consumption, private sector investment and foreign demand continue to strengthen. Fiscal stimulus is offsetting a significant share of the drag on growth from physical distancing. As elsewhere, the pandemic’s effects are expected to reduce China’s potential output, especially productivity and investment growth. 

Many EMEs have been hit hard by the virus. India and many Latin American countries face particularly severe and ongoing outbreaks that are constraining activity, especially in the services sector. In East Asia, although the virus is relatively well controlled, recent data suggest that caution is keeping economic activity somewhat subdued. 

The recovery in most EMEs is projected to be slower than in China and advanced economies. The capacity of many EMEs to shift to remote work is limited. Financial vulnerabilities and constraints on their ability to provide fiscal policy support are also expected to dampen the recovery in EMEs. Physical distancing effects and lower potential output result in downward revisions to the outlook from the July Report for oil-importing EMEs. These factors weigh on economies in the rest-of-the-world block as well, with low oil prices also reducing estimates of their potential output.

Oil prices have been steady in recent weeks as the global recovery slows and oil supply gradually increases. Global oil prices remain about one-third lower than their pre-pandemic levels. Reductions in air travel and ground transportation as well as high oil inventories are contributing to persistently low oil prices. 

As in the July Report, the Bank assumes that Brent and West Texas Intermediate prices will remain close to US$40 per barrel and Western Canadian Select will stay around US$30 per barrel. Risks around this assumption are tilted modestly to the upside over the medium term because oil prices may rise further as the global economy recovers. 

Indexes for non-energy commodity prices are now exceeding their pre-pandemic levels. The recovery in global manufacturing and China’s infrastructure investment growth have bolstered prices for base metals. Forestry product prices surged over the summer because earlier cuts to production left inventories low while US housing demand strengthened. 
Increased supply and slowing demand growth have since helped stabilize lumber prices.
	
The Canadian economy has now entered the recuperation phase of the recovery. As anticipated, rapid economic growth from easing containment measures over the summer has transitioned to a more moderate pace. The recent reintroduction of some containment measures in response to rising numbers of COVID-19 cases is expected to have a negative impact on economic activity in the near term.

The economic effects of the pandemic have been highly uneven. Some activity has been relatively unaffected, or even boosted, by the virus and containment measures. In other cases, businesses were partially or fully shut down but have been able to reopen, with activity returning close to pre‑pandemic levels. In contrast, businesses in sectors that require close physical contact continue to be disproportionately affected. The effects have been similarly uneven across households.

Recognizing the ongoing challenges—particularly the severe impacts on low‑income households—governments have extended and modified income support programs since the July Report. Meanwhile, monetary policy continues to keep borrowing costs low for Canadian businesses and households.

The economic recovery is projected to be prolonged, underpinned by policy support but largely influenced by the evolution of the virus, ongoing uncertainty and structural changes to the economy. These changes could result in longer‑term shifts of workers and capital across different regions and sectors of the economy. This adjustment process weighs on the Bank’s estimates of potential growth.

After declining by about 5 1/2 percent in 2020, the economy is expected to expand by almost 4 percent on average in 2021 and 2022. Two factors will likely lead to quarterly patterns of growth that are unusually choppy: localized outbreaks and containment measures, and varied rates of recovery across industries. 

Inflation is expected to remain below the lower end of the Bank’s inflation-control target range of 1 to 3 percent until early 2021, largely due to the effects of low energy prices. Subsequently, inflation is anticipated to be within the target range, but economic slack will continue to put downward pressure on inflation throughout the projection period.

Growth is estimated to have rebounded strongly in the third quarter, reversing about two-thirds of the decline observed in the first half of the year. A sizable bounce back in activity resulted from a rebound in foreign demand, the release of pent‑up demand for housing and some durable goods, and robust policy support.

Housing activity recovered sharply in the third quarter, supported by historically low financing costs, resilient incomes for higher‑earning households, and extra sales and construction that made up for delayed spring activity. By September, cumulative resales are estimated to have compensated for the activity that was missed during the normally busy spring market. Housing activity may also be benefiting from changes in preferences. In particular, more than one‑quarter of respondents to the Canadian Survey of Consumer Expectations in the third quarter of 2020 reported they would like to move to a larger or single‑family home because of the pandemic.

The strength of the housing market recovery, combined with a tight resale market, has led to rapid growth of house prices in some markets. In contrast to the appreciation of house values observed in Toronto and Vancouver in 2016, price growth has been strongest in markets with moderate loan‑ to‑income ratios, such as Ottawa, Montréal and Halifax. 

Households have been adapting to an environment with physical distancing measures. Consumers are spending less on services that involve higher risks of infection, such as travel, personal care services and recreation. At the same time, they are spending relatively more on goods such as groceries and electronics. As a result, sales of most goods are estimated to have recovered in the third quarter to near pre‑pandemic levels.
 
Saving and spending patterns have diverged across households. Some lower‑income workers who lost their jobs are receiving support payments that exceed their pre‑pandemic income levels, permitting them to increase their savings. For other laid‑off workers, support payments fall well short of pre‑pandemic incomes. Meanwhile, higher‑income households have been less affected by job losses but have curtailed their typical spending, mainly on services that require a greater degree of in-person interaction. The overall savings rate has risen significantly.

Investment and exports have not had as strong a recovery as household spending. Both have rebounded from their lows in the second quarter but remain subdued, with significant weakness in some sectors. Some non‑commodity exports, such as motor vehicles and parts as well as consumer goods, have recovered quickly. In contrast, exports of industrial machinery and equipment and other capital goods have lagged. Energy exports remain weak amid low oil prices, soft demand and ongoing structural challenges in the industry.

The Bank estimates that economic growth will be very modest in the fourth quarter. The immediate boost to growth from the reopening of businesses and pent‑up demand is seen as having largely occurred over the summer. In addition, the reintroduction of some containment measures in several provinces and the adverse effects on confidence stemming from the recent rise in the number of cases of COVID‑19 are expected to further 
dampen fourth-quarter growth.

In summary, the rebound in activity occurred sooner and growth was stronger than expected in the July Report. The upward revision to estimated growth in the third quarter was driven by housing, consumption and exports. This revision is larger than the downward revision in the fourth quarter, so the estimated level of real activity at the end of the year is around 3 percent higher than in the central scenario of the July Report.

Labour markets have improved significantly since the economy reopened. However, about 720,000 people were still out of work in September because of pandemic-related job losses—substantially more than the peak level of job losses during the 2008–09 recession. Employment continued its strong recovery through the third quarter, although the pace of job gains is expected to slow considerably in the coming months as growth wanes.

The impact of the COVID‑19 crisis continues to be highly uneven across firms and workers. Recovery in the hardest‑hit sectors—including accommodation and food services, recreation, and travel—continues to lag. Workers in these sectors continue to face elevated levels of unemployment. Overall, payments under the Canada Emergency Response Benefit program have offset income losses for those in the lowest income quartile. Youth and low‑wage workers continue to be disproportionately affected, while unevenness across other groups has diminished in recent months. However, the breadth and intensity of re‑imposed containment measures, including impacts on schools and the availability of child care, could lead to setbacks. Long breaks in employment have the potential for longer‑term impacts on the income prospects of vulnerable groups.

In the autumn 2020 Business Outlook Survey (BOS), a majority of firms reported that labour and capacity pressures remained subdued, consistent with other indicators of material excess capacity. Some firms, however, noted shortages for specific types of labour or disruptions to the supply chain for particular goods as a result of the pandemic. Firms surveyed in the BOS indicated that they expect price and wage pressures to remain muted over the coming year.

Overall, the large gap between supply and demand that opened with the onset of the pandemic is estimated to have significantly narrowed in the third quarter, as the economy rebounded. Nonetheless, considerable economic slack remains. The Bank estimates that the output gap was between −3 and −4 percent in the third quarter of 2020.

At 0.5 percent in September, consumer price index (CPI) inflation remains well below the Bank’s target range, as anticipated in the July Report. Prices for CPI components that fell sharply because of weak demand early in the pandemic, including gasoline and travel accommodations, remain low compared with their levels from a year ago. Meanwhile, prices for products that saw a surge in demand early in the pandemic have started easing (for example, household cleaning and paper products). As a result, overall price pressures remain subdued. An adjusted price index, which accounts for the dramatic changes in the consumption patterns of Canadians since the start of the pandemic, is increasing at a rate that is only slightly higher than CPI inflation.

Measures of core inflation have been below 2 percent, consistent with an economy where demand has fallen by more than supply, implying economic slack. Core inflation measures, which are designed to capture broad inflationary pressures, have declined by less than CPI inflation. The low rate of CPI inflation is being driven by large declines in prices for a small number of items that together have significant weight in the CPI basket.

In this Report, the Bank provides its reassessment of potential output growth. The outlook for potential output is considerably weaker than in the April 2019 Report. Factors related to the pandemic explain most of the revisions. Containment measures also have temporary effects on supply—lowering the growth of supply relative to potential in 
2020 and boosting it in 2021.

Even without the temporary effects from containment measures, potential output growth is estimated to be lower than in the April 2019 Report. The downward revision reflects long-lasting effects from the pandemic. Slower capital accumulation is expected to weigh on trend labour productivity growth for years to come. In addition, some laid‑off workers may exit the labour market if they are unable to find new jobs, putting downward pressure on trend labour input growth. As a result, potential output growth is estimated to average 1.2 percent over 2022 and 2023, much lower than the estimated average growth of 1.8 percent over 2010–18.

As usual, the Bank’s assessment of potential output is subject to consider­able uncertainty, and estimates are presented as a range. The degree of uncertainty has been magnified by the pandemic.

Growth is expected to average close to 4 percent over 2021 and 2022 as the economy recuperates. This implies that GDP does not return to its pre-pandemic level until the start of 2022, and the output gap is not closed until considerably later. The recovery is expected to continue to be uneven: activity in some sectors remains largely unaffected by the pandemic or containment measures, while other sectors struggle and face a prolonged recovery. For these sectors, uncertainty and its drag on growth are expected to persist but steadily diminish over time. The recovery will remain uneven and only partial until the pandemic is over.

The Bank anticipates that fiscal policy will continue to provide important support to the economy throughout the recovery. In light of recent federal and provincial announcements, the projection incorporates additional fiscal support relative to the July Report. The new fiscal measures, including broadened eligibility for employment insurance and new benefit programs, have strengthened the outlook for disposable income. The impact of fiscal stimulus on GDP is strongest in 2020 and early 2021. In contrast, there are longer lags in the monetary transmission mechanism, so the impacts of the monetary policy actions that have been taken are expected to continue to build.
 
The overall outlook for consumption and housing is being driven by employment and disposable income, pandemic‑induced changes in behaviour, and uncertainty. In addition, low interest rates are expected to support spending, especially on residential investment and durable goods, such as motor vehicles.

Consumption and housing demand, as well as potential output, are supported over the projection horizon by resumed immigration. The pace of arrivals in Canada is expected to return to pre‑pandemic levels in 2021. However, the assumption for the future path of the total population has been revised lower as a result of the pandemic.

Consumption growth is anticipated to remain around 4 percent over the projection horizon. Over this period, two factors weighing on consumption should gradually become less important. The first is physical distancing, which restricts spending on services such as travel, hospitality and personal care. The second is uncertainty, which is increasing precautionary savings. These factors contributed to an unusually large jump in the savings rate in 2020. As the effects of these factors diminish, household 
spending should increase.

Overall, the outlook for residential investment reflects the implications of pandemic‑related shifts in housing preferences, lower population and decreased borrowing costs. As pent-up demand recedes, home resales are expected to moderate in 2021 from record levels in the second half of 2020. Renovations should remain resilient over the projection horizon, with people spending more time at home. 
 
Exports return to pre‑pandemic levels by mid‑2022 in the projection, underpinned by a gradual improvement in foreign demand. Low energy prices restrain growth of energy exports, and travel exports will continue to be subdued until international tourism resumes.

The recovery in imports is also expected to be gradual. Imports of machinery and equipment are anticipated to be weak as uncertainty hampers investment by Canadian firms. At the same time, imports of consumer goods are expected to recover along with consumer demand. Imports of services should begin to recover when borders gradually reopen.

Business investment is expected to increase gradually, in line with soft domestic and foreign demand. Uncertainty is expected to remain a significant drag on firms’ investment decisions. In particular, firms face considerable uncertainty about the long‑term nature of some of the changes in business practices and in household preferences and behaviours resulting from the pandemic. Some shifts may persist, while others could revert relatively quickly once conditions begin to normalize. For example, the planned return of workers to centralized offices remains unclear, which creates significant uncertainty for firms’ investments in buildings and facilities.

Investment outside the oil and gas sector is held back by subdued business sentiment. As a result, investment does not surpass its pre‑pandemic level until mid‑2022.

Investment in the oil and gas sector is even more challenged because of low oil prices and difficult financing conditions, and it is not expected to return to pre‑pandemic levels over the projection horizon. As a result, capital expenditure plans and oil production in Canada remain significantly below 2019 levels throughout the projection horizon. Following a roughly 30 percent contraction in 2020, oil and gas investment is projected to grow by just over 2 percent in 2021–22. While risks to the oil price assumption are skewed to the upside, modestly higher prices are unlikely to lead to a significant increase in investment.

Inventory investment is expected to contribute positively to growth over the projection horizon as firms rebuild depleted stocks.

In the projection, the path for CPI inflation over the next year largely reflects the dynamics of energy prices and the gradual narrowing of excess capacity. The dramatic decline in gasoline prices in March and April will hold inflation down until early 2021. After that, CPI inflation is expected to pick up. Nevertheless, looking through quarter‑to‑quarter volatility, CPI inflation is expected to be below target in 2021 and 2022 as a result of ongoing slack. For example, about one‑quarter of the jobs lost during the containment have yet to return. With some sectors unable to reopen completely until the virus has passed, excess supply is expected to exert downward pressure on inflation over the entire projection horizon.

Other factors could lead to movements in inflation. Higher operating costs from physical distancing measures, such as increased sanitation procedures or additional staff, could be a source of upward price pressures (for example, the “COVID‑19 fees” seen in some hair salons).

Medium‑ and long‑term inflation expectations remain well anchored at the 2 percent target. Most firms responding to the autumn 2020 Business Outlook Survey anticipate that inflation will remain within the Bank’s inflation-control target range of 1 to 3 percent over the next two years. Expectations for inflation two years from now remain relatively stable and close to levels observed before the pandemic. Most respondents to the Canadian Survey of Consumer Expectations in the third quarter of 2020 anticipate that inflation will be within that range or just above it over the next two years. The September 2020 Consensus Economics forecast for Canadian CPI inflation is 0.7 percent in 2020 and 1.7 percent in 2021. Responses to a quarterly question on long‑term inflation expectations show an average of 2.0 percent through 2030.

The uncertainty around the projection remains extraordinarily high, given that the projection is conditional on the evolution and size of the economic impacts of the pandemic. The outlook could be significantly different if COVID-19 infection rates and containment measures are more or less favourable than assumed in this Report. The economic outlook would be stronger if the pandemic were to end before mid-2022. This would be the case if, for example, effective vaccines were to become widely available earlier than expected. The drag on economic growth from physical distancing and reduced confidence would dissipate more rapidly, boosting household spending and business investment. Long-term scarring effects on investment and labour would also be smaller.

In contrast, the pandemic and related economic impacts could be more severe than anticipated. In the projection, COVID-19 outbreaks are assumed to be reasonably well managed through local and targeted containment measures. There is a serious risk, however, that broader or more intensive restrictions could be required.  

There is also considerable uncertainty about the long-term impacts of the pandemic. The more serious the pandemic, the larger the associated restructuring and reallocation of resources.

Even if the course of the pandemic proceeds as assumed in the base-case projection, the Bank sees a number of upside and downside risks to the outlook for inflation. The risks to the economic outlook and inflation are viewed as roughly balanced. Downside risks pose a greater concern because inflation is currently low and the policy rate is at the effective lower bound. Some of the more important risks are listed below.

US growth could be materially stronger than in the base-case projection. Authorities may reach an agreement to enact substantial additional fiscal stimulus measures. Stronger growth in the United States would provide further support to Canadian export growth and 
investment activity.

Household savings have increased dramatically since the pandemic began. This has reflected more limited opportunities to spend, particularly for higher-income households, as well as increased precautionary savings. If more of these savings are spent, consumption and residential investment could be stronger than anticipated in the projection, and the savings rate could decline more quickly than expected. For example, households could become less cautious about their spending or more confident about economic conditions, even in the absence of a vaccine or effective treatment.

Important financial vulnerabilities remain in many countries due to elevated debt levels and the high degree of economic uncertainty. Worsening pandemic conditions and economic setbacks could lead to increased risk premiums and sharply tighter financial conditions. This could be particularly severe for EMEs and have broader spillovers. 

In Canada, slower growth and tighter financial conditions, combined with high levels of household and corporate indebtedness, could lead to rising numbers of insolvencies and bankruptcies. This, in turn, could lead to losses in the financial system, a tightening in credit conditions and a reduction in bank lending. This would create a new headwind to growth.
