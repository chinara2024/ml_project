Canada’s Inflation-control strategy*
Inflation control and the economy
• Inflation control is not an end in itself; it is the means whereby monetary policy contributes to
solid economic performance.
"• Low, stable and predictable inflation allows the economy to function more effectively. This"
contributes to better economic growth over time and works to moderate cyclical fluctuations in
output and employment.
The monetary policy instrument
• Announcements regarding the Bank’s policy instrument—the target overnight interest rate—take
"place, under normal circumstances, on eight pre-specified dates during the year."
"• In setting a target for the overnight rate, the Bank of Canada influences short-term interest rates"
to achieve a rate of monetary expansion consistent with the inflation-control target. The trans-
mission mechanism is complex and involves long and variable lags—the impact on inflation from
changes in policy rates is usually spread over six to eight quarters.
The targets
"• In February 1991, the federal government and the Bank of Canada jointly agreed on a series of"
targets for reducing total CPI inflation to the midpoint of a range of 1 to 3 per cent by the end of
"1995. The inflation target has been extended a number of times. In November 2006, the agree-"
"ment was renewed for a period of five years to the end of 2011. Under this agreement, the Bank"
"will continue to conduct monetary policy aimed at keeping total CPI inflation at 2 per cent, with a"
control range of 1 to 3 per cent around the target.
Monitoring inflation
"• In the short run, a good deal of movement in the CPI is caused by transitory fluctuations in the"
"prices of such volatile components as fruit and gasoline, as well as by changes in indirect taxes."
"For this reason, the Bank uses a core measure of CPI inflation as an indicator of the underlying"
trend in inflation. This core measure excludes eight of the most volatile components of the CPI
and adjusts the remaining components to remove the effect of changes in indirect taxes.

Monetary Policy Report
January 2011
This is a report of the Governing Council of the Bank of Canada:
"Mark Carney, Tiff Macklem, John Murray, Timothy Lane, Jean Boivin and Agathe Côté."
We must improve our competitiveness. Recovery
after a recession demands that capital and labour be
reallocated. The surge in business investment that
began this past summer can only be the start.

BANK O F CANADA    MONETARY POLICY REPORT    january 2011
This report includes data received up to 14 January 2011.
Overview
The global economic recovery is proceeding at a somewhat faster pace than
"the Bank had anticipated, although risks remain elevated. Private domestic"
demand in the U nited States has picked up and will be reinforced by recently
announced monetary and fiscal stimulus. European growth has also been
slightly stronger than anticipated. O ngoing challenges associated with sover-
eign and bank balance sheets will limit the pace of the European recovery
and are a significant source of uncertainty to the global outlook. In response
"to overheating, some emerging markets have begun to implement more"
restrictive policy measures. Their effectiveness will influence the path of
­
"commodity prices, which have increased significantly since the O ctober"
"Monetary Policy Report, largely reflecting stronger global growth."
"The recovery in Canada is proceeding broadly as anticipated, with a period"
of more modest growth and the beginning of the expected rebalancing of
demand. The contribution of government spending is expected to wind down
"this year, consistent with announced fiscal plans. Stretched household bal-"
ance sheets are expected to restrain the pace of consumption growth and
"residential investment. In contrast, business investment will likely continue to"
"rebound strongly, owing to stimulative financial conditions and competitive"
imperatives. Net exports are projected to contribute more to growth going
"forward, supported by stronger U. S. activity and global demand for com-"
"modities. However, the cumulative effects of the persistent strength in the"
Canadian dollar and Canada’s poor relative productivity performance are
restraining this recovery in net exports and contributing to a widening of
Canada’s current account deficit to a 20-year high.
"Overall, the Bank projects the economy will expand by 2.4 per cent in 2011"
and 2.8 per cent in 2012—a slightly firmer profile than had been anticipated in
October. W
"ith a little more excess supply in the near term, the Bank continues"
to expect that the economy will return to full capacity by the end of 2012.
"Underlying pressures affecting prices remain subdued, reflecting the con-"
siderable slack in the Canadian economy. Core inflation is projected to edge
"gradually up to 2 per cent by the end of 2012, as excess supply in the"
economy is slowly absorbed. Inflation expectations remain well anchored.
Total CPI inflation is being boosted temporarily by the effects of provincial
"indirect taxes, but is expected to converge to the 2 per cent target by the end"
of 2012.
"Despite improvements in the outlook for the global and Canadian economies,"
"risks to inflation remain elevated. There are two main upside risks to inflation,"
relating to higher commodity prices and the possibility of greater-than-projected
momentum in the Canadian household sector.

BANK O F CANADA    MONETARY POLICY REPORT    January 2011
"There are two main downside risks to inflation, relating to Canadian competi-"
tiveness and the possibility of weaker-than-projected household expenditures
in Canada.
"In addition, challenges in Europe continue to be a significant source of uncer-"
tainty for the global outlook. A comprehensive solution to the sovereign debt
and financial stability issues in a number of countries will be required.
The Bank judges that the risks to the inflation outlook are roughly balanced
over the projection horizon.
"Reflecting all of these factors, on 18 January 2011 the Bank decided to maintain"
the target for the overnight rate at 1 per cent. The Bank Rate is correspondingly
"1 1/4 per cent, and the deposit rate is 3/4 per cent. This leaves considerable"
"monetary stimulus in place, consistent with achieving the 2 per cent inflation"
target in an environment of significant excess supply in Canada. Any further
reduction in monetary policy stimulus would need to be carefully considered.

The Global Economy
The global economic recovery is proceeding at a somewhat faster pace
"than anticipated in the O ctober Monetary Policy Report. In the U nited States,"
private demand has picked up and will be reinforced by recently announced
monetary and fiscal stimulus. Momentum in the emerging-market economies
"has been buoyed by solid increases in consumption and investment, as well"
as continuing strength in exports. Economic activity in the euro area has
also been slightly stronger than expected.
"Nonetheless, the global recovery continues to be affected by a number of"
"significant challenges. The broad forces of household, bank and sovereign"
deleveraging will continue to restrain growth in many advanced economies.
Ongoing balance-sheet repair and a weak labour market will dampen the
"recovery in U. S. household expenditures, while in some European countries,"
more aggressive fiscal consolidation and renewed concerns about bank
balance sheets and the sustainability of public finances are also expected
"to constrain growth. In contrast, many emerging-market economies are"
contending with excess demand and rising inflationary pressures. Their
efforts to contain these pressures are being complicated in some cases by
a lack of exchange rate flexibility.
Recent Developments
Global economic growth continued at a steady pace during the second half
of 2010 and has been somewhat stronger than expected at the time of the
"October Report. In the U nited States, despite weak labour market conditions,"
"economic activity has gained some momentum, supported by a recovery in"
"consumer and investment spending. G rowth in Europe has also held up, in"
spite of heightened concerns about sovereign debt in several peripheral
"countries. G rowth in J apan, in contrast, slowed sharply toward the end of"
"2010, following the unwinding of some fiscal support. The pace of economic"
activity in emerging-market economies also began to ease from high rates
"toward the end of 2010, reflecting the gradual withdrawal of fiscal and monetary"
"stimulus. Nevertheless, these economies have accounted for the majority of"
global growth (Chart 1).
"Owing to significant excess capacity, policy interest rates in the major"
"advanced economies remain at or near historic lows (Chart 2), and under-"
"lying inflation pressures are subdued (Chart 3). In the U nited States, core"
consumer price inflation has reached record lows since the O ctober Report.
"In contrast, inflation pressures in many emerging-market countries are"
rising in response to excess demand.
The global economic recovery is
­
proceeding at a somewhat faster pace.
"In the United States, despite weak"
"labour market conditions, economic"
activity has gained some momentum.

Real G DP in the U nited States grew at an annual rate of 2.6 per cent in the
third quarter of 2010 and is estimated to have accelerated to 3.7 per cent in
"the fourth quarter, owing to a pickup in consumer spending and a large, but"
"temporary, drop in oil imports. The strength in consumption in the fourth"
"quarter was led by a surge in spending on durable goods, particularly on"
"motor vehicles. Although the household savings rate has eased somewhat,"
it nevertheless remains at a level consistent with the rebuilding of household
balance sheets over the medium term (Chart 4). Conditions in the U. S.
"labour market remain challenging, with only one in seven of the jobs lost"
"during the recession recovered so far, and long-term unemployment"
remaining near postwar highs.

"U.S. residential investment fell sharply in the second half of 2010, delaying"
the expected recovery of the housing sector. A high level of vacant housing
"units, the recent tightening in bank lending standards for mortgage loans"
and increases in mortgage interest rates continue to restrain residential
investment (Chart 5). Delays in processing foreclosures related to proced-
ural flaws are also likely to slow the adjustment of the housing market.
"Although business investment in structures fell further in the third quarter,"
recent indicators suggest that the trough is close to being reached. In
­
"contrast, investment in equipment and software has recovered most of the"
ground lost through the recession as firms have sought to replace the capital
that had depreciated and to improve competitiveness. The growth of exports
U.S. residential investment fell sharply
in the second half of 2010.

"gathered significant momentum during the second half of 2010, supported by"
"strong demand from emerging-market economies, the depreciation of the"
U.S. dollar over the past year and solid gains in productivity.
"Toward year-end, in response to pronounced weakness in the U. S. labour"
"market and record-low core inflation, U.S. policy-makers introduced addi-"
tional stimulus measures (Technical Box 1). As expected at the time of the
"October Report, the Federal Reserve announced a second round of quanti-"
"tative easing in November. In addition, the U. S. government passed legisla-"
tion in December to provide significant further fiscal stimulus over the next
two years.
"In the euro area, real G DP rose by 1.4 per cent in the third quarter of 2010,"
"and available indicators point to fairly robust growth in the fourth quarter,"
"concentrated in the core countries, especially G ermany. G rowth in the"
­
"peripheral economies was restrained, however, by fiscal tightening,"
"increased concerns about sovereign debt and the banking sector, and a"
lack of competitiveness.
"In J apan, data released since the O ctober Report show that the recession"
"was deeper and the rebound in 2010 was stronger, leaving the recent level"
of G DP slightly weaker than previously measured. Economic growth in 2010
benefited from both robust external demand and fiscal stimulus programs
designed to promote consumption. G rowth is estimated to have weakened
"significantly in the fourth quarter, however, reflecting the removal of certain"
fiscal incentives supporting household spending and the recent appreciation
of the yen.
Real G DP in China grew by slightly less than 10 per cent over the second half
"of 2010 on a year-over-year basis. Domestic demand remained vigorous,"
supported by buoyant growth in investment spending and solid increases
"in consumption, while housing activity continued to rise, despite earlier"
attempts to cool the sector. In an effort to counteract rising inflationary
"pressures, the Chinese authorities have tightened monetary policy further,"
with a combination of interest rate increases and various administrative
measures (Technical Box 2).
U.S. policy-makers introduced
­
additional stimulus measures.

BANK O F CANADA    MONETARY POLICY REPORT    january 2011 9
The Bank of Canada’s index of global commodity prices has increased by
"14 per cent since the O ctober Report (Chart 6), primarily reflecting solid"
"demand, especially from Asia. In addition, there may have been some impact"
from financial flows into commodities. Natural gas prices rose by 26 per cent in
"response to seasonal factors but, owing to ample supply, remained well below"
their average level of recent years. O il prices have increased by about 12 per
"cent, driven by stronger global demand for crude oil and declining inventories,"
while non-energy commodity prices have risen by close to 11 per cent since
"the O ctober Report, reflecting solid gains in most components."
Developments in Global Financial Markets
"Conditions in global financial markets remain generally accommodative,"
despite heightened concerns over fiscal challenges and vulnerable banking
sectors in some European countries.
Government bond yields in the major advanced economies have increased
"since the O ctober Report (Chart 7), but nevertheless remain low by histor-"
ical standards. The rise in yields appears to largely reflect upward revisions
to expectations for global economic growth following the release of positive
"economic data and, in the case of the U nited States, additional fiscal stimulus."
"In late O ctober and November, investors became increasingly worried about"
"public finances in the peripheral countries of Europe and, in some cases,"
the budgetary impact of stresses in the banking sector. Credit spreads for
"the most affected sovereigns widened sharply (Chart 8), and the turbulence"
"affected several euro-area countries. In response, European policy-makers"
"announced various measures to safeguard financial stability, including a"
stabilization package for Ireland and more aggressive fiscal consolidation
measures in several countries. The European Central Bank also increased
the size of its exceptional liquidity support to euro-area banks and purchases
of sovereign bonds in the secondary market. Financial market developments
since then suggest that additional measures may be required.
The Bank of Canada’s index of global
commodity prices has increased by
14 per cent since the October Report.
The rise in yields appears to largely
reflect upward revisions to expectations
for global economic growth.
European policy-makers announced

stability.

"Notwithstanding these stresses, most global equity and corporate bond mar-"
"kets have continued to perform strongly since the O ctober Report, owing to"
solid corporate earnings and revenues and generally better-than-expected
economic data. G lobal corporate bond markets continue to see robust issuance
"and lower spreads, particularly on riskier securities such as high-yield corporate"
"debt, reflecting strong investor demand and increasing risk appetite (Chart 9)."
"In response to better fundamentals and growing investor interest, the curren-"
cies of several emerging-market countries have come under continued upward
pressure against the U. S. dollar. Although authorities in these countries have
reduced the frequency and scale of their foreign exchange interventions since
"October, several have imposed capital controls and other administrative meas-"
ures. These policy interventions risk inhibiting the process of real exchange rate
adjustment required to correct global imbalances and sustain the recovery.
The currencies of several emerging-
market countries have come under
continued upward pressure.

Outlook for the Global Economy
The global economic recovery is projected to continue at a solid pace over
2011–12 (Table 1) as private domestic demand becomes more firmly
entrenched. G lobal growth is expected to be somewhat stronger over the
2011–12 period than was anticipated in the O ctober Report. Although the
effects of the debt crisis in peripheral Europe are expected to restrain global
"economic growth over the projection horizon, these effects are more than"
offset in 2011 by the impact of stronger momentum in the U nited States and
emerging-market economies.
Real GDP in the U nited States is projected to rise by 3.3 per cent on an
average annual basis in 2011 and by 3.2 per cent in 2012. U.
S. growth is
"expected to be stronger in 2011 than anticipated in the O ctober Report,"
"owing to the new fiscal stimulus program, combined with a more rapid"
recovery in consumer spending (Chart 10).

Growth in U. S. household spending is projected to be supported through
2012 by a measured improvement in the pace of job creation. This is against
a backdrop of exceptionally weak labour market conditions at present and a
"long-term unemployment rate that has reached historic highs. As well, in"
"2011, the new fiscal measures should provide an additional impetus to  ."
household spending through tax reductions that boost disposable income.
"However, U. S. state and local governments are expected to limit spending"
"and raise taxes to address large budget gaps, partially counteracting the"
federal government’s fiscal stimulus. Consumption will also continue to be
affected by the need to repair household balance sheets and by develop-
"ments in the housing sector, where a large excess supply of unsold houses is"
projected to have a persistent restraining effect on prices.
U.S. business investment in equipment and software is expected to
"strengthen further in response to low financing costs, improved bank lending"
"terms and a more positive growth outlook. However, high vacancy rates in the"
"commercial and retail sectors, combined with tighter credit terms for firms in"
"these sectors, should continue to dampen growth in investment in structures."
Net exports are expected to make an increasingly positive contribution to
"growth over the projection horizon, aided by a further depreciation of the U. S.-"
dollar real effective exchange rate and firming external demand for U. S. goods
and services.
"In the euro area, a modest recovery is projected through 2012. Nevertheless,"
the region faces considerable risks and challenges. Recent indicators ­suggest
that growth in early 2011 will be somewhat firmer than anticipated in the
"October Report, especially in the core European economies. Economic activity"
"is expected to be somewhat weaker thereafter, reflecting fiscal ­austerity meas-"
ures and financial pressures arising from continuing concerns about the sus-
tainability of peripheral-country debt. G rowth prospects in heavily indebted
peripheral economies are much weaker and more uncertain than those of the
"core economies. Despite ambitious deficit-cutting plans, the peripheral coun-"
tries will continue to be vulnerable to shifts in market sentiment because of their

substantial debt-refinancing requirements and relatively weak financial sys-
"tems. Moreover, they will remain heavily dependent on the resilience in the core"
"economies, given the large intra-region concentration of their exports."
Economic growth in J apan is projected to slow over 2011–12 in response to the
unwinding of fiscal stimulus and the earlier appreciation of the yen. G rowth
"nevertheless remains somewhat above that of potential output, reflecting a"
gradual broadening of the recovery. An improvement in labour market condi-
"tions is expected to provide some support to domestic demand. However,"
exports are projected to be an important driver of growth through 2012.
"In China, a gradual rotation of demand toward consumption and away from"
"investment and exports is expected to occur over the projection horizon, facili-"
tated by a modest appreciation of China’s real effective exchange rate. G rowth
in China is projected to be somewhat higher in 2011 than was anticipated in the
"October Report, driven by stronger momentum in domestic demand. However,"
"growth in 2012 is expected to be slightly weaker than anticipated, owing to the"
restraining effects of tighter monetary and credit measures.
Real G DP growth is projected to slow slightly in other emerging-market econ-
omies. A removal of the fiscal stimulus introduced during the recession and a
tightening in monetary policy in reaction to growing inflationary pressures are
"expected to moderate the growth of domestic demand. Moreover, a modest"
appreciation of real exchange rates in these economies is projected to con-
strain the growth of their net exports.
The Bank’s commodity price index is expected to increase over the projec-
"tion horizon, supported by the global economic recovery. Following recent"
"sharp increases, prices for non-energy commodities are expected to remain"
relatively steady over the projection horizon as growing demand is largely
offset by increases in supply. The latest futures curves suggest that oil prices
"will average U S$95 in 2012, and that natural gas prices will continue to rise as"
the excess supply is drawn down (Chart 11).
Growth in China is projected to
be somewhat higher in 2011 than
"was anticipated, driven by stronger"
momentum in domestic demand.

BANK O F CANADA    MONETARY POLICY REPORT    january 2011 15
The Canadian Economy
"The Canadian economy is now in a period of more modest growth, following"
the strong recovery experienced in late 2009 and early 2010. As in the O ctober
"Report, the Bank projects a moderate pace of overall expansion, with accom-"
modative financial conditions continuing to provide support as fiscal stimulus
unwinds. Demand in Canada is expected to rely relatively less on household
and government expenditures and more on business investment and net
exports. The projected increase in the contribution to growth from net exports
is supported by the improved near-term outlook for U. S. and global economic
"growth. However, the cumulative effects of Canada’s poor relative produc-"
tivity performance and the persistent strength in the Canadian dollar have
eroded Canada’s competitiveness and are restraining the recovery in net
exports.
"As projected in the O ctober Report, growth is expected to absorb the con-"
"siderable slack in the economy by the end of 2012. In this context, total and"
core inflation are projected to gradually return to 2 per cent over that horizon.
Recent Developments
Economic Activity
Real G DP growth in Canada slowed to 1.0 per cent (at an annual rate) in
the third quarter. This was a slightly weaker result than had been expected
"in the O ctober Report (Chart 12), as strength in domestic demand in the"
third quarter was largely offset by a further deterioration in net exports.
"Consumer spending continued to grow robustly in the third quarter, while"
"housing investment remained at a high level, despite the passing of several"
transitory supports to activity. The strength in consumer spending was in
line with the growth of personal disposable income through the second and
"third quarters, leaving the savings rate near its historical low."
Business investment continued to grow vigorously in the third quarter.
"Despite the strong increase in business investment since the end of 2009,"
"however, less than half of the unusually large decline that occurred during"
the recession has been recovered (Chart 13).
Net exports exerted a more significant than expected drag on growth in the
"third quarter, as exports declined despite the further recovery in foreign"
activity and imports continued to be boosted by strong domestic demand.
Poor relative productivity and the persistent strength in the Canadian dollar
have accounted for continued weakness in net exports (Technical Box 3).
"However, the softness in exports in the third quarter was also attributable to"
such temporary factors as the idling of oil pipelines.
The Bank projects a moderate pace of
"overall expansion, with accommodative"
financial conditions continuing to pro-
vide support as fiscal stimulus unwinds.
Consumer spending continued to grow
"robustly, while housing investment"
remained at a high level.
The Canadian ec onomy .
BANK O F CANADA    MONETARY POLICY REPORT    january 2011
16
The Bank estimates that economic growth picked up to 2.3 per cent in the
"fourth quarter, reflecting a rebound in net exports and a deceleration in"
household expenditures and business investment from their recent rapid
"pace of growth. Following large contributions in previous quarters, inven-"
"tories likely subtracted from G DP growth in the fourth quarter, consistent"
with stabilizing the trend in the stock-to-sales ratio.

Estimated Pressures on Capacity
Various indicators of capacity suggest that considerable slack remains in
the Canadian economy.
The Bank’s conventional measure of the output gap indicates that excess
"capacity in the economy was relatively stable in the fourth quarter, at about"
-1.8 per cent (Chart 14). The Bank’s winter Business Outlook Survey (avail-
able on the Bank’s website under Publications and Research > Periodicals)
reported that the proportion of firms that would have difficulty responding
"to an unexpected increase in demand remains below its historical average,"
as does the proportion of firms facing labour shortages. The still-elevated
unemployment rate and the weakness in average weekly hours worked also
point to the persistence of slack in the labour market (Chart 15).
"On balance, the Bank judges that the economy was operating at about"
"1 3/4 per cent below its production capacity in the fourth quarter of 2010,"
a slightly greater degree of slack than the Bank had projected in O ctober.

Inflation and the 2 Per Cent Target
"Core inflation has remained below 2 per cent in recent months (Chart 16),"
"consistent with considerable excess supply in the economy, as well as the"
moderation in the growth of unit labour costs (Chart 17). There is some
evidence that HST-related tax refunds to businesses may also have been
"passed through, dampening core inflation in line with the Bank’s expecta-"
tions. The 1.6 per cent average rate for core inflation in O ctober and
November was consistent with the Bank’s projection at the time of the
October Report.

BANK O F CANADA    MONETARY POLICY REPORT    january 2011 21
"Total CPI inflation has risen in recent quarters, mainly reflecting the impact of the"
"HST and other changes in provincial indirect taxes that took effect in J uly, as well"
as higher energy prices. Total CPI inflation in O ctober and November averaged
"2.2 per cent, slightly above the Bank’s expectations in the O ctober Report."
Recent survey measures continue to indicate that inflation expectations are well
anchored at the 2 per cent target. As reported in the Bank’s winter Business
"Outlook Survey, 91 per cent of firms expect average inflation over the next two"
years to remain within the 1 to 3 per cent control range. The J anuary Consensus
Economics forecast for total CPI inflation was 2.2 per cent in 2011 and 2.1 per
cent in 2012. Market-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations also
continue to be consistent with the 2 per cent inflation-control target.
Canadian Financial Conditions
"Financial conditions in Canada remain exceptionally stimulative, providing"
important ongoing support to the economic recovery.
Effective borrowing costs for households remain very low by historical stan-
"dards, consistent with the low level of bank funding costs (Chart 18)."
"Nonetheless, borrowing costs have risen over the past year, including a mar-"
ginal increase in the period since the O ctober Report that reflects higher
"yields on Canadian government bonds, in line with global developments. In"
"this context, the growth of household credit has eased modestly relative to"
the rapid pace seen earlier in 2010 (Chart 19).
Effective borrowing costs for Canadian businesses have also stayed very low
"despite some increase in 2010. As well, in recent months, access to financing"
"has continued to improve for Canadian firms, according to both the Bank’s"
Senior Loan Officer Survey (available on the Bank’s website under
Publications and Research > Periodicals) and the Business Outlook Survey
(Chart 20). The Senior Loan Officer Survey suggests that heightened compe-
tition among lenders and more favourable economic conditions have driven an
"overall easing in lending conditions, which has increasingly spread to smaller"
businesses. The improved global economic outlook and the still-low level of
government bond yields have underpinned strong investor demand for
Recent survey measures continue to
indicate that inflation expectations are
well anchored at the 2 per cent target.
"In recent months, access to financing"
has continued to improve for Canadian
firms.

"corporate bonds and equities, reflected in the persistence of narrow credit"
spreads despite elevated corporate bond issuance and further recovery in the
"S&P/TSX Composite Index. Favourable financing conditions, as well as the"
ongoing recovery in business investment and increased activity in mergers
"and acquisitions, have contributed to the observed pickup in the overall"
growth of business credit (Chart 19).
Growth in the narrow monetary aggregates has continued to slow in recent
"months from the unusually rapid pace set earlier in 2010, consistent with"
reduced liquidity preference among households and firms. G rowth in the
"broader M2++ aggregate remains below its historical average, suggesting"
subdued inflation pressures ahead.

Outlook for the Canadian Economy
The Bank’s base-case projection incorporates the following key assumptions:
a Canada/U.S. exchange rate averaging 100 cents U. S.; energy prices in line
with recent futures prices; relatively steady prices for non-energy commod-
ities; and supportive global credit conditions.
Aggregate Demand and Supply
The Bank continues to expect moderate economic growth through 2011
"and 2012 (Chart 22). As the expansion progresses, demand in Canada is"
"projected to rely increasingly on business investment and net exports, and"
less on government and household expenditures (Table 2 and Chart 23).
"On an average annual basis, real G DP is projected to grow by 2.4 per cent"
The Bank continues to expect moderate
economic growth through 2011 and

BANK O F CANADA    MONETARY POLICY REPORT    january 2011 25
"in 2011 and 2.8 per cent in 2012, a slightly stronger growth profile than had"
been anticipated at the time of the O ctober Report. More robust growth in
"business investment, as well as heightened near-term momentum in house-"
"hold expenditures and U. S. and global demand, account for the modestly"
"improved outlook. Nonetheless, weaker growth in the second half of 2010"
"implies somewhat greater excess capacity in the near term. Thus, the Bank"
continues to expect the economy to return to full capacity only by the end
of 2012.
Growth in consumer spending is expected to evolve broadly in line with that
of personal disposable income over the projection horizon. The government’s
recently announced mortgage insurance measures will contribute to a more
balanced path for household expenditures.
"As in the O ctober Report, growth in disposable income is expected to mod-"
"erate from its recent trend as a result of the withdrawal of fiscal stimulus,"
announced compensation restraints by governments and a slow recovery in
average hours worked. W
ith Canadian household balance sheets becoming
increasingly stretched and consumption unlikely to be bolstered by gains in
"house prices, growth in household spending is expected to moderate in line"
with income growth. This means that the savings rate is projected to remain
near historic lows and household debt near historic highs (Chart 24). These
"factors, taken together with reduced affordability, point to a weakening in"
residential investment over the projection horizon. The Bank expects the
"share of the economy accounted for by residential investment, and by house-"
"hold expenditures more broadly, to decline gradually but remain well above"
historical averages (Chart 25).
"The Bank’s base-case scenario, which takes into account the federal gov-"
ernment’s recent announcement that stimulus measures will be extended
"through O ctober, continues to assume that the contribution of government"
spending to real G DP growth will turn negative over the projection horizon.
The savings rate is projected to remain
near historic lows and household debt
near historic highs.

"investment and net exports, and less on government and household"
expenditures

The rapid increase in business investment is expected to continue over the
projection horizon as the unusually sharp decline experienced during the
recession is unwound (Chart 26). This reflects the solid financial positions
"of Canadian firms (Chart 27), favourable credit conditions, higher com-"
"modity prices, the stronger Canadian dollar, and the impetus to improve"
productivity amid heightened pressures to become more competitive as the
global economy recovers. The Bank’s Business Outlook Survey has also
indicated a consistently high level of investment intentions in recent quar-
"ters. Reflecting all of these factors, the Bank expects a somewhat more"
robust recovery in capital spending than previously projected.
The rapid increase in business invest-
ment is expected to continue over the
projection horizon.

"Consistent with the O ctober Report, the Bank expects an improvement in net"
exports over the projection horizon as external demand recovers and growth in
Canadian domestic demand moderates from its previous rapid pace. W
hile
near-term growth prospects in the U nited States and other foreign economies
"have significantly improved of late, competitiveness challenges are expected to"
leave the projected profile of Canadian export growth only slightly stronger
than previously anticipated. The rebalancing of domestic demand toward busi-
ness investment and pressures on Canadian competitiveness also imply higher
imports relative to the profile of overall domestic demand. The strength of net
exports will continue to be sensitive to currency movements and the expected
"recovery in productivity growth, in addition to prospects for external demand."
The Bank expects an improvement in net
exports over the projection horizon.

The Projection for Inflation
The outlook for core inflation is broadly unchanged from the O ctober
Report. Core inflation is projected to gradually edge up to 2 per cent by the
"end of 2012 (Table 3 and Chart 28), as excess supply in the economy is"
"slowly absorbed. Inflation expectations remain well anchored. As well,"
"ongoing modest growth in labour compensation, combined with an antici-"
"pated pickup in productivity, is expected to restrain growth in unit labour"
"costs and, in turn, dampen inflation pressures."
The near-term profile for core inflation is slightly more subdued than previ-
"ously anticipated, consistent with slightly greater excess supply in the near"
"term. In the first quarter, the 12-month rate of core inflation will also be"
dampened by the unusual price increases for motor vehicles and hotel
accommodation that occurred in early 2010.
Total CPI inflation is projected to remain slightly higher than the 2 per cent
"target over the first half of 2011, as the HST and other changes in provincial"
indirect taxes continue to boost the 12-month rate of change in consumer
prices.
"1 As with previous changes in indirect taxes, for the purposes of"
"monetary policy, the Bank is looking through the first-round effect on prices"
"of these changes. Excluding the impact of changes in indirect taxes, total"
"CPI inflation is expected to gradually converge to the 2 per cent target,"
broadly in line with the projected profile for core inflation.
This projection includes a gradual reduction in monetary stimulus over the
"projection horizon, consistent with achieving the inflation target."
"1	 The direct impact of changes in consumption taxes in O ntario, British Columbia and Nova Scotia is"
a temporary rise of 0.7 percentage points in the year-over-year rate of increase in the total CPI from
July 2010 to J une 2011. The increase in the provincial sales tax in Quebec in J anuary 2011 is expected  .
to add about 0.1 percentage points to total CPI inflation over 2011.
Core inflation is projected to gradually
edge up to 2 per cent by the end of
2012.

BANK O F CANADA    MONETARY POLICY REPORT    january 2011 31
Risks to the Outlook
Despite improvements in the outlook for the global and Canadian econ-
"omies, risks remain elevated."
"There are two main upside risks to inflation, relating to higher commodity"
prices and the possibility of greater-than-projected momentum in the
Canadian household sector:

" The global economy could be stronger than currently anticipated, par-"
ticularly if measures to moderate demand in emerging-market econ-
"omies prove insufficient. This could boost commodity prices, which"
would increase incomes in Canada and support stronger investment
activity and household spending.

 There could be stronger-than-expected momentum in household
expenditures in Canada. W
ith exceptionally stimulative financing condi-
"tions, borrowing could continue to grow faster than income."
"There are two main downside risks to inflation, relating to Canadian com-"
petitiveness and the possibility of weaker-than-projected household
expenditures:

 The Bank expects net exports to provide greater support to the
"Canadian economic expansion over the projection horizon. However,"
with ongoing productivity challenges and the persistent strength of the
"Canadian dollar, the anticipated recovery in net exports may not fully"
"materialize. Moreover, renewed tensions in foreign exchange markets"
could inhibit the necessary global adjustment and put additional pres-
sure on freely floating currencies.

 With household expenditures in Canada significantly above their histor-
"ical average as a share of G DP, growth in household spending might"
"decelerate more rapidly than is currently anticipated. Relatedly, if there"
"were a sudden weakening in the Canadian housing sector, it could have"
"sizable spillover effects on other areas of the economy, such as con-"
"sumption, given the high debt loads of some Canadians."
"In addition, challenges in Europe continue to be a significant source of"
uncertainty for the global outlook. A comprehensive solution to the sover-
eign debt and financial stability issues in a number of countries will be
required.
"Overall, the Bank judges that the risks to the inflation outlook are roughly"
balanced over the projection horizon.
