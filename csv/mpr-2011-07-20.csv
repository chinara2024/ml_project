Canada’s Inflation-control strategy*
Inflation control and the economy
• Inflation control is not an end in itself; it is the means whereby monetary policy contributes to
solid economic performance.
"• Low, stable and predictable inflation allows the economy to function more effectively. This"
contributes to better economic growth over time and works to moderate cyclical fluctuations in
output and employment.
The monetary policy instrument
• Announcements regarding the Bank’s policy instrument—the target overnight interest rate—take
"place, under normal circumstances, on eight pre-specified dates during the year."
"• In setting a target for the overnight rate, the Bank of Canada influences short-term interest rates"
to achieve a rate of monetary expansion consistent with the inflation-control target. The trans-
mission mechanism is complex and involves long and variable lags—the impact on inflation from
changes in policy rates is usually spread over six to eight quarters.
The targets
"• In February 1991, the federal government and the Bank of Canada jointly agreed on a series of"
targets for reducing total CPI inflation to the midpoint of a range of 1 to 3 per cent by the end of
"1995. The inflation target has been extended a number of times. In November 2006, the agree-"
"ment was renewed for a period of five years to the end of 2011. Under this agreement, the Bank"
"will continue to conduct monetary policy aimed at keeping total CPI inflation at 2 per cent, with a"
control range of 1 to 3 per cent around the target.
Monitoring inflation
"• In the short run, a good deal of movement in the CPI is caused by transitory fluctuations in the"
"prices of such volatile components as fruit and gasoline, as well as by changes in indirect taxes."
"For this reason, the Bank uses a core measure of CPI inflation as an indicator of the underlying"
trend in inflation. This core measure excludes eight of the most volatile components of the CPI
and adjusts the remaining components to remove the effect of changes in indirect taxes.

OVERVIEW
BANK OF CANADA    MONETARY POLICY REPORT    JULY 2011
This report includes data received up to 15 July 2011.
Overview
"The global economic expansion is proceeding broadly as projected in April,"
with modest growth in major advanced economies and robust expansions in
emerging economies. The U.S. economy has grown at a slower pace than
expected and continues to be restrained by the consolidation of household
balance sheets and slow growth in employment. While growth in core
"Europe has been stronger than expected, necessary fiscal austerity meas­"
ures in a number of countries will restrain growth over the projection horizon.
The Japanese economy has begun to recover from the disasters that struck
"in March, although the level of economic activity in that country will remain"
"below previous expectations. In contrast, growth in emerging-market econ­"
"omies, particularly China, remains very strong. As a consequence, com­"
"modity prices are expected to remain at elevated levels, following recent"
"declines. These high prices, combined with persistent excess demand in"
"major emerging-market economies, are contributing to broader global infla­"
tionary pressures. Widespread concerns over sovereign debt have increased
risk aversion and volatility in financial markets.
"In Canada, the economic expansion is proceeding largely as projected,"
although the expected rotation of demand is somewhat slower than had
been anticipated. Household spending remains solid and business invest­
"ment robust. Net exports remain weak, reflecting modest U.S. demand and"
"ongoing competitiveness challenges, particularly the persistent strength of"
"the Canadian dollar. Despite increased global risk aversion, financial condi­"
tions in Canada remain very stimulative and private credit growth is strong.
Following an anticipated slowdown in growth during the second quarter due to
temporary supply-chain disruptions and the impact of higher energy prices on
"consumption, the Bank expects growth in Canada to re-accelerate in the"
"second half of 2011. Over the projection horizon, business investment is"
"expected to remain strong, household spending to grow more in line with"
disposable income and net exports to become more supportive of growth.
"Relative to the April projection, growth in household spending is now projected"
"to be slightly firmer, reflecting higher household income, and net exports to be"
"slightly weaker, reflecting more subdued U.S. activity. Overall, the Bank pro­"
"jects the economy will expand by 2.8 per cent in 2011, 2.6 per cent in 2012 and"
"2.1 per cent in 2013, returning to capacity in the middle of 2012."
"Total CPI inflation is expected to remain above 3 per cent in the near term,"
largely reflecting temporary factors such as significantly higher food and
"energy prices. Core inflation is slightly firmer than anticipated, owing to"
temporary factors and to more persistent strength in the prices of some
services. Core inflation is now expected to remain around 2 per cent over the
projection horizon. Total CPI inflation is expected to return to the 2 per cent
2
OVERVIEW
BANK OF CANADA    MONETARY POLICY REPORT    JULY 2011
"target by the middle of 2012 as temporary factors unwind, excess supply in"
"the economy is gradually absorbed, labour compensation growth stays"
"modest, productivity recovers and inflation expectations remain well"
anchored.
The Bank’s projection assumes that authorities are able to contain the
"ongoing European sovereign debt crisis, although there are clear risks around"
this outcome.
"More broadly, there are a number of risks to the outlook for inflation in"
Canada. The three main upside risks to inflation in Canada relate to the
"possibility of higher-than-projected commodity prices and global inflation,"
"stronger momentum in Canadian household spending, and the possibility"
that there is less excess capacity in the Canadian economy.
The three main downside risks to inflation in Canada relate to sovereign debt
"concerns in Europe, headwinds from the persistent strength of the Canadian"
dollar and the possibility that growth in Canadian household spending could
be weaker than projected.
"Overall, the Bank judges that the risks to the inflation outlook in Canada are"
roughly balanced over the projection horizon.
"Reflecting all of these factors, on 19 July, the Bank maintained the target for"
the overnight rate at 1 per cent. To the extent that the expansion continues
"and the current material excess supply in the economy is gradually absorbed,"
some of the considerable monetary policy stimulus currently in place will be
"withdrawn, consistent with achieving the 2 per cent inflation target. Such"
reduction would need to be carefully considered.

BANK OF CANADA    MONETARY POLICY REPORT    JULY 2011 3
The Global Economy
The global economic expansion is proceeding broadly as expected at the
time of the April Monetary Policy Report. Growth prospects in many
advanced economies continue to be affected by the ongoing repair of
"household, bank and government balance sheets. Although high com­"
modity prices and the disasters in Japan contributed to weaker growth in
"the first half of 2011, economic activity in these economies is expected to"
rebound through the second half of the year and continue to grow at a
"steady pace through 2012–13, although on a somewhat lower track. Unlike"
"the situation in most advanced economies, growth in emerg­"
ing-market
economies has remained exceptionally strong. Excess demand in many of
"these economies, coupled with past increases in commodity prices, is"
creating broader global inflationary pressures.
Widespread concerns over sovereign debt have increased risk aversion
and volatility in financial markets. Contagion from recent developments in
"Greece has been felt most acutely in euro-area financial markets, impacting"
"banks, non-financial corporations and other euro-area sovereigns. Financial"
"conditions for banks, non-financial corporations and sovereigns in other"
countries generally remain very supportive.
Recent Developments
Developments during the first half of 2011 differed significantly across eco­
"nomic regions. Growth has slowed in the United States, but has been fairly"
"solid in the euro area as a whole. In Japan, the disasters triggered on"
11 March caused a marked contraction in economic activity as well as
disruptions to global production networks. Growth in emerging-market
"economies, in contrast, continues to be robust (Chart 1). Increasing"
demand from these countries has been the principal driver of the rise in
"world commodity prices, unlike in earlier periods when demand from"
advanced economies accounted for most of the movements in these prices.
Real GDP growth in the United States decelerated to slightly below 2.0 per
"cent in the first half of 2011, owing to a pronounced slowing in household"
spending. Growth in U.S. consumption continues to be constrained by the
"ongoing repair of household balance sheets. In addition, consumption"
"spending has been restrained by a number of temporary factors, including"
"the rapid rise in oil and food prices and supply-chain disruptions from Japan,"
which limited the available stock of Japanese motor vehicles in the United
States. These temporary effects are expected to dissipate in coming months
"and growth is projected to pick up in the second half of the year, albeit at a"
somewhat slower pace than was anticipated at the time of the April Report.
"Historical revisions indicate that, consistent with sluggish labour market con­"
"ditions, growth in U.S. real personal disposable income since the fourth"

quarter of 2010 has been weaker than initially reported (Chart 2). The per­
sonal savings rate fell from a recent peak of 6.3 per cent in June 2010 to
"5.0 per cent in May 2011, suggesting that household balance-sheet repair has"
"not progressed as far as anticipated, especially in the context of falling"
housing prices and lower equity prices.
U.S. residential investment fell further in the first half of the year as persis­
tently high unemployment and the weak financial situation of households
continued to dampen housing demand. The inventory of vacant homes also
"remained elevated, leading to additional downward pressure on house prices"
with further negative implications for household and bank balance sheets.
"Non-residential construction remains weak, but conditions in this sector"
appear to be stabilizing. The most recent survey of bank lending conditions
noted a slight easing in standards for commercial real estate loans for the first
time since 2005 as well as an increase in the demand for loans.
Strong growth in exports and business investment in equipment and software
continued to underpin U.S. economic growth over the first half of the year
(Chart 3). Business investment has been bolstered by healthy corporate
balance sheets and the low cost of capital. U.S. exports have benefited from
"robust external demand and improved international price competitiveness,"
brought about by solid productivity growth and a sizable depreciation in the
U.S. real effective exchange rate.
"In the euro area, real GDP growth rebounded to 3.4 per cent in the first"
"quarter, following weather-related disruptions at the end of 2010. Available"
"indicators point to slower, but still solid, growth in the second quarter. Overall,"
economic activity in the first half of the year was stronger than anticipated
"in the April Report, mainly reflecting more robust growth in investment."
"Fundamentals remain strong in the core economies, most notably in"
"Germany, where the unemployment rate is at a post-unification low. Some"
"peripheral economies continue to face significant challenges, however."
"Greece, in particular, has had difficulty delivering the fiscal adjustments"
required as part of the financing programs that it received from the
International Monetary Fund and the European Union. Weak macroeconomic

Real GDP growth in Japan contracted sharply in the first quarter. Damage
caused by the earthquake and tsunami in March constrained the growth of
exports and led to a significant decline in private domestic demand. Falling
"inventories also had a negative effect on growth, since the disruptions to"
production forced firms to run down their existing stocks to meet demand.

"more severe than anticipated in the April Report, recent indicators suggest"
that it has bottomed out.
Economic growth in China eased slightly from 9.8 per cent in the fourth
"quarter of 2010 to 9.5 per cent in the second quarter of 2011, owing in part to"
the monetary tightening undertaken in the past year. Despite the modest
"deceleration in economic growth, excessive credit expansion, sharp"
increases in property prices and rapid growth in real estate investment have
raised doubts about the sustainability of the current growth path. High local
"government debt levels, combined with significant government and bank"
"exposures to the property sector, are adding to concerns about financial"
stability. Excess demand conditions still prevail and inflationary pressures are
rising. Consumer price inflation currently stands at 6.4 per cent—its highest
"level in three years. In the past three months, in an effort to mitigate infla­"
"tionary pressures, authorities in China have raised the reserve requirement"
"ratio for financial institutions by 150 basis points, bringing it to a historical"
high of 21.5 per cent for large institutions. Authorities have also raised official
"interest rates by 25 basis points, to 3.5 per cent in the case of the one-year"
"deposit rate, which remains negative in real terms. Efforts to contain infla­"
tionary pressures appear to have been inhibited by the lack of flexibility in the
country’s exchange rate.
"Despite recent declines, global commodity prices remain high by historical"
"standards, supported by robust demand from emerging-market economies"
and tight global supply conditions (Chart 4). Prices for oil and metals have
"fallen sharply since the last Report, reflecting market expectations for weaker"
"economic growth, some unwinding of financial positions and, in the case of"
"oil, the release of strategic petroleum reserves by the International Energy"
"Agency. North American natural gas prices, in contrast, are little changed"
"from their levels at the time of the April Report, while agricultural prices have"
experienced a modest correction in response to an improved outlook for
grain harvests.
Past increases in food and energy prices continue to exert upward pressure
on inflation in both advanced and emerging-market economies (Chart 5).
These pressures are being exacerbated in many emerging-market econ­
omies by excess demand and rapid growth in wages and credit. Monetary

authorities in the emerging-market economies have taken measures to
"contain these inflation pressures, but monetary conditions nevertheless"
"remain exceptionally stimulative, suggesting that inflation pressures are"
likely to persist. Major advanced countries have also had to contend with
"rising commodity prices, but underlying inflation pressures continue to be"

core inflation and significant excess capacity. Policy interest rates in these
economies have therefore remained low (Chart 6).

Developments in Global Financial Markets
Conditions in global financial markets remain supportive. Several develop­
"ments have weighed on investor sentiment in recent weeks, however,"
leading to heightened risk aversion and increased volatility.
Equity prices in advanced and emerging-market economies have declined
over the past three months in reaction to greater uncertainty about the
strength of the global recovery (Chart 7). Conditions in corporate credit
markets have also deteriorated somewhat. Although corporate bond yields
"remain close to their historical lows, corporate credit spreads have wid­"
"ened, especially for high-yield issuers. Corporate bond issuance has also"
"fallen sharply, albeit from very elevated levels. Capital has shifted into per­"
"ceived safe-haven assets and currencies, putting downward pressure on"
government bond yields in major advanced economies (Chart 8).
Market concerns about acute fiscal strains in some euro-area peripheral
"countries, especially Greece, Portugal and Ireland, have increased notice­"
"ably, as demonstrated by the sharp widening in their sovereign spreads to"
new record levels (Chart 9). In contrast to the period surrounding the April
"Report, when sovereign debt concerns were mostly confined to the weakest"
"peripheral countries, there have been signs of contagion spreading to other"
European sovereigns: Spanish and Italian 10-year bond spreads have
reached their highest levels since the introduction of the euro.
"Contagion has also extended to the European banking sector, with bank"
"stocks falling significantly. Commercial banks in Greece, Ireland and"
Portugal have experienced serious funding problems and have relied
heavily on central bank liquidity. Other European banks have faced some
"deterioration in wholesale funding conditions, reflecting their direct and"
indirect exposures to vulnerable sovereigns.
Investor confidence in the fiscal positions of a number of advanced econ­
omies has also weakened. Lengthy negotiations in the United States on the
debt ceiling and the inability of U.S. policy-makers to agree on a longer-
term solution to that country’s debt problem have weighed on market senti­
"ment, which was already fragile."
Market concerns about acute fiscal
strains in some euro-area peripheral
countries have increased noticeably

Outlook for the Global Economy
Growth in the global economy is projected to average about 4.0 per cent
"annually through 2013 (Table 1). Compared with the April Report, growth"
"has been marked down in 2011, owing mostly to a weaker near-term outlook"
"for the United States and Japan, but it is broadly similar thereafter. As pro­"
"jected in past reports, deleveraging by households and sovereigns is"
expected to restrain growth in many advanced economies. The Bank’s
base-case projection assumes that authorities are able to contain the
"ongoing European sovereign debt crisis, but includes a slightly lower profile"
for GDP growth in Europe. A rebalancing of growth within emerging-market
"countries, with greater reliance on consumption spending, is expected to"
help support export growth in the advanced economies and set the global
recovery on a more sustainable path.

Real GDP growth in the United States is projected to strengthen in the
"second half of 2011, averaging about 3¼ per cent. The pickup in growth is"
"driven largely by stronger consumption spending, assisted by the recent"
"decline in oil prices, as well as a rebound in manufacturing production as"
imports of motor vehicle parts from Japan gradually return to normal.
U.S. real GDP is also expected to rise by about 3¼ per cent on an average
annual basis over the 2012–13 period. This growth profile is broadly in line
"with expectations at the time of the last Report, but nevertheless implies a"
lower GDP track than previously anticipated. The rise in GDP is modest by
"post-recession standards (Chart 10), reflecting the restraining effects of"
ongoing balance-sheet repair by households as well as an expected
tightening in fiscal policy. Significant fiscal consolidation is incorporated into
the Bank’s base-case projection. This exerts a drag on U.S. GDP growth of
roughly 1 percentage point in 2012 and 1.7 percentage points in 2013.
U.S. consumption is projected to grow at a steady pace of approximately
"2 per cent through 2013, supported by a gradual recovery in the labour"
market that more than offsets the dampening effects of ongoing household
balance-sheet repair and the drag on personal disposable income coming
from fiscal consolidation. The recovery in new residential construction is
expected to be further delayed and then to proceed gradually over the
"projection horizon, given the elevated supply of vacant homes. A modest"
recovery in the construction of non-residential structures is also expected
over this period.
Exports and business investment in equipment and software are expected
to remain the key drivers of the U.S. economic expansion. Supported by the
"low cost of capital and firming economic conditions, business investment"
should continue to grow at a robust pace through 2013. Growth in net
exports is expected to benefit from further improvements in U.S. cost
competitiveness and an anticipated rebalancing of GDP growth in the
emerging-market economies toward increased domestic demand and
higher imports.
"Euro-area GDP is expected to expand at a moderate pace through 2013,"
although at a somewhat weaker rate than projected in the April Report.
Fiscal and financial strains associated with the debt crisis are expected to
weigh more heavily on the region’s growth prospects over the next three
"years. As a result, the two-speed pace of the recovery in Europe is pro­"
"jected to continue, with solid momentum in most of the core economies and"
persistent challenges in the periphery.

BANK OF CANADA    MONETARY POLICY REPORT    JULY 2011 11
A reconstruction-led recovery is projected for Japan over the forecast hor­
izon. Improving labour market conditions should also support the growth of
private domestic demand over this period.
"In China, real GDP growth is expected to remain strong, but should moderate"
through 2012–13 in response to monetary tightening and a further real appre­
"ciation of the Chinese currency. These developments, as well as structural"
"reforms, should facilitate a rebalancing of growth away from capital investment"
and exports and toward consumption. This rotation of demand should help
"diffuse pressures in the real estate market and dampen inflationary pressures,"
thereby reducing the probability of a sharper downturn in the future.
Economic growth in other emerging-market economies is expected to remain
"robust, reflecting persistent strength in domestic demand and buoyant"
regional and global trade. Growth is projected to decelerate gradually over
"the projection period, however, as tighter monetary and fiscal policies reduce"
excess demand and inflationary pressures. A modest further appreciation of
their real exchange rates should also help to restrain export growth.
"Although commodity prices are expected to be lower than in the April Report,"
"they are projected to remain at historically elevated levels, supported by solid"
demand from emerging-market economies and limited increases in supply.
"Based on the latest futures curve, oil prices should remain relatively stable,"
increasing slightly from current levels and reaching $104 per barrel by the end
"of 2013. Natural gas prices are also expected to rise, based on the latest"
"futures curve (Chart 11), but increased shale production should keep them"
low relative to their historical relationship with oil prices. Non-energy com­
modity prices are projected to stay close to their current levels over the next
"three years, with a steady increase in metals production and a normalization"
of crop yields offsetting the effects of growing global demand.
"In China, real GDP growth is expected"
"to remain strong, but should moderate"
through 2012–13
Although commodity prices are
"expected to be lower than in April, they"
are projected to remain at historically
elevated levels

BANK OF CANADA    MONETARY POLICY REPORT    JULY 2011 13
The Canadian Economy
"In Canada, the economic expansion has been proceeding largely as"
expected in the April Report. While the supply-chain disruptions resulting
from the recent disasters in Japan are leading to volatility in the near-term
"profile of activity, the broader outlook is little changed, with the Bank con­"
tinuing to project a moderate pace of growth ahead. The rebalancing of
"aggregate demand in Canada is gradually unfolding, albeit at a somewhat"
slower pace than anticipated. Business investment is growing strongly and
contributions to growth from government expenditures are diminishing. The
Bank continues to project a moderation in the growth of household
"expenditures, although this is expected to proceed more gradually than in"
"the April projection, reflecting higher personal disposable income. At the"
"same time, net exports have become less of a drag on growth, but further"
improvement will be restrained by the downwardly revised profile for U.S.
growth and ongoing competitiveness challenges.
Core inflation has been slightly firmer than projected in the April Report and
is now expected to remain around 2 per cent over the projection horizon.
"Total CPI inflation is expected to remain above 3 per cent in the near term,"
largely reflecting temporary factors. It is expected to return to the 2 per cent
"target by the middle of 2012 as temporary factors unwind, excess supply in"
"the economy is gradually absorbed, labour compensation growth stays"
"modest, productivity recovers and inflation expectations remain well"
anchored.
Recent Developments
Economic Activity
Real GDP in Canada grew at an annual rate of 3.9 per cent in the first
"quarter of 2011, broadly as expected in the April Report. In the second"
"quarter, growth has slowed sharply, as expected, largely as a result of"
temporary factors.
Growth in overall household expenditures continued to moderate in the first
"quarter, despite solid growth in personal disposable income and favourable"
financial conditions (Chart 12). Growth in consumer spending was very
"weak, restrained in part by the adjustment to higher prices for food and"
"energy, while residential investment rebounded strongly, reflecting some"
pulling forward of activity in advance of changes in mortgage insurance
"regulations. At 4.2 per cent, the personal savings rate in the first quarter"
was somewhat higher than had been anticipated at the time of the April
"Report, reflecting both the weakness in consumption and upward revisions"
to the level of personal disposable income through 2010. Growth in govern­
ment expenditures also moderated in the first quarter.

"Business fixed investment continued to grow at a rapid pace, reflecting"
higher spending on both machinery and equipment and non-residential
"structures. Despite its strong rebound since the end of 2009, business fixed"
investment had recovered only two-thirds of its unusually sharp reces­
sionary decline by the end of the first quarter (Chart 13).
"Net exports exerted some drag on overall GDP growth in the first quarter,"
"as anticipated in the April Report, in part reflecting Canada’s ongoing com­"
petitiveness challenges. Growth in exports moderated from the rapid pace
of late 2010 as exports of non-energy commodities and machinery and

growth. Growth in imports reflected a resumption of inventory accumula­
"tion, as well as ongoing strength in business investment in machinery and"
equipment.
The Bank estimates that economic growth slowed sharply to 1.5 per cent in
"the second quarter, a slightly greater deceleration than expected in the April"
Report. The slowdown in the second quarter is largely attributable to the
expected moderation in government spending as well as to temporary
"factors, notably the effects of higher food and energy prices on consumer"
spending in Canada and the United States and supply-chain disruptions
related to the Japanese disasters in March. The Bank now estimates that
these supply disruptions will subtract roughly three-quarters of a per­
"centage point from GDP growth in Canada in the second quarter, a slightly"
larger impact than projected in the April Report. The boost to activity in the
"second half of 2011 as conditions normalize is, correspondingly, expected"
to be slightly greater than previously anticipated.
Estimated Pressures on Capacity
Indicators of capacity pressures in Canada have been mixed. The level of
real GDP has been marginally lower in the first half of 2011 than the Bank
"had projected, suggesting a greater degree of slack than previously antici­"
"pated. However, some indicators of capacity pressures suggest that the"
economy may be operating closer to its production potential. The Bank’s
conventional measure of the output gap for the second quarter of 2011
"stood at -0.7 per cent (Chart 14). In addition, the Bank’s summer Business"
Outlook Survey (available on the Bank’s website under Publications and
Research > Periodicals > BOS Summer 2011) finds that the proportion of
firms indicating that they would have difficulty responding to an unexpected
"increase in demand has risen above its historical average. Nonetheless, the"
proportion of firms reporting significant capacity constraints remains low.
"Moreover, key labour market indicators, such as the unemployment rate,"

average hours worked and the proportion of involuntary part-time workers
"(Chart 15), as well as the below-average proportion of firms facing labour"
"shortages as reported in the Bank’s survey, point to significant excess"
capacity.
"On balance, the Bank judges that the economy was operating at slightly"
less than 1 per cent below its production capacity in the second quarter of
"2011, roughly the same degree of slack as the Bank had anticipated in April."
Inflation and the 2 Per Cent Target
"Core CPI inflation rose to an average of 1.7 per cent in April and May, from"
"1.3 per cent in the first quarter (Chart 16), partly because of the passing of"
a number of transitory factors that had been dampening it.
"1 In addition, the"
gradual pass-through of the surge in world agricultural commodity prices
has resulted in a significant rise in core food prices. While these increases
"have been consistent with expectations at the time of the April Report, price"
"developments for many services have been slightly firmer than expected,"
although wage growth has remained modest (Chart 17). The prices of semi-
durable goods have also been slightly firmer than expected. The gap
between prices in Canada and the United States for a number of durable
"and semi-durable goods, adjusted for the exchange rate, remains wide."
The increase in total CPI inflation from 2.6 per cent in the first quarter to an
average of 3.5 per cent in April and May has been larger than anticipated in
"the April Report, owing to a greater-than-expected rise in Canadian gaso­"
"line prices, as well as firmer-than-expected core inflation."
Measures of short-term inflation expectations remain consistent with earlier
sharp increases in world commodity prices and their observed effects on
total CPI. The July Consensus Economics forecast for total CPI inflation
was 3.0 per cent in 2011 and very close to the target in 2012 (2.1 per cent).
"1	 In February, this particularly reflected the effects of unusually large price increases a year earlier for"
"motor vehicles and hotel accommodation (the latter related to the Vancouver Winter Olympics), as well"
as rebates on electricity prices in Ontario.

"demand for mortgage credit, notably the lagged effects of the surge in"
"sales of existing homes in the fourth quarter of last year, as well as some"
pulling forward of activity related to recent changes to mortgage insurance
"regulations. With the passing of these temporary factors, the pace of"
expansion of household credit has recently moderated somewhat.
The Bank’s Senior Loan Officer Survey for the second quarter of 2011 (avail­
able on the Bank’s website under Publications and Research > Periodicals
> SLOS 2011Q2) indicated a further easing in the lending conditions faced
"by a wide range of firms (Chart 20), reflecting heightened competition"
"among lending institutions and from capital markets, as well as a more"
favourable domestic economic outlook. Results from the summer Business
Outlook Survey also point to a further easing in credit conditions for firms of
all sizes.
"Investor demand for risky assets in Canada has generally remained strong,"
"partly reflecting the low level of government bond yields. Accordingly, credit"
spreads have stayed narrow and corporate bond issuance in Canada has
"been relatively strong, although issuance has declined in recent weeks amid"
increased global risk aversion. The Canadian S&P/TSX Composite Index
"has retreated from its peak earlier in 2011, along with other major world"
stock markets. In response to favourable financing conditions and the
"robust ongoing recovery in business investment, growth in total business"
credit has remained fairly strong in recent months.
Compared with the unusually rapid pace registered between the end of
"2008 and early 2010, growth in the narrow monetary aggregates has been"
"moderate in recent months, consistent with reduced liquidity preference"
among households and firms. Growth in the broader M2++ aggregate has
"been edging up but remains below its historical average, continuing to"
suggest subdued inflation pressures ahead.

Exchange Rate
The Canadian dollar has averaged 103 cents U.S. since the May fixed
"announcement date, in line with the level assumed in the April Report. It has"
"been volatile since the end of June, reflecting broader financial market"
developments. The Canadian-dollar effective exchange rate index (CERI)
has moved in a similar fashion (Chart 21).
Outlook for the Canadian Economy
The Bank’s base-case projection incorporates the following key assump­
tions: a Canada/U.S. exchange rate averaging 103 cents U.S.; energy prices
in line with recent futures prices; persistently strong prices for non-energy
commodities; and supportive global credit conditions.
Aggregate Demand and Supply
The Bank’s outlook for the Canadian economy is little changed from the
"April Report, with a generally moderate pace of expansion expected."
Following a rebound in the second half of 2011 related to the unwinding of
"supply disruptions, economic growth in Canada is expected to slow toward"
the economy’s potential rate of growth over the projection horizon (Table 2
and Chart 22). The Bank continues to expect that the rotation of aggregate
demand in Canada away from household and government expenditures
toward business fixed investment and net exports will persist over the pro­
"jection horizon (Chart 23). Relative to the April Report, growth in household"
"spending is expected to be slightly firmer, while downward revisions to"
projected U.S. demand and ongoing competitiveness challenges are
expected to slow the improvement in Canada’s net exports.
"On an average annual basis, real GDP is projected to grow by 2.8 per cent"
"in 2011 and 2.6 per cent in 2012, while growth in 2013 is expected to mod­"

"tion for household spending is slightly higher than in the April Report,"
although the Bank continues to expect household expenditures as a share

The Bank continues to project that the contribution of government spending
to real GDP growth will be negative through the balance of 2011 and into
"2012, consistent with the previously announced unwinding of fiscal"
stimulus. The profile for government expenditures has been adjusted from

Business fixed investment is expected to continue to rise rapidly over the
"projection horizon, with considerable scope remaining to offset the"
unusually sharp decline experienced during the recession (Chart 26). The
buoyant outlook for investment reflects the solid financial positions of
"Canadian firms, favourable credit conditions, high commodity prices and"
"the strong Canadian dollar, as well as the impetus to improve productivity"
amid heightened pressures to become more competitive. The Bank’s
Business Outlook Survey has also indicated a consistently high level of
investment intentions in recent quarters.

BANK OF CANADA    MONETARY POLICY REPORT    JULY 2011
24
The Bank continues to expect an improvement in net exports over the pro­
jection horizon as exports recover with rising external demand and import
growth slows along with the moderation in the growth of domestic demand.
"However, the recovery in exports is likely to be modest, given Canada’s"
"ongoing competitiveness challenges, which stem primarily from the persis­"
tent strength of the Canadian dollar (Technical Box 1). The expected
recovery in Canadian exports over the medium term is now projected to be
"even more muted than in the April Report, reflecting negative revisions to"
"the projected pace of U.S. demand growth (Chart 27), although the growth"
in exports in the second half of 2011 is likely to be temporarily boosted by
the unwinding of supply-chain disruptions. The Bank continues to expect
that the expansion in imports will be underpinned by solid growth in busi­
"ness investment, because of its typically high import content and, more"
"generally, by greater import penetration due to the persistent strength of the"
Canadian dollar. Net exports will continue to be sensitive to currency move­
"ments and the expected recovery in productivity growth, as well as to the"
prospects for external demand.
The Projection for Inflation
The Bank expects core inflation to remain around 2 per cent over the pro­
jection horizon as excess supply in the economy is slowly absorbed and
inflation expectations remain well anchored (Table 3 and Chart 28).
Transitory factors are expected to push core inflation slightly above 2 per
"cent on a temporary basis. As in the April Report, the Bank expects that the"
dampening effects of HST-related tax refunds passed on by businesses a
year ago will fade in coming quarters.
2 The lagged effects of higher prices
"2	 While core CPI inflation excludes the direct impact of changes in indirect taxes, total CPI inflation reflects"
both the direct and indirect effects of such changes. With the direct positive impact estimated to have
been larger than the indirect dampening effect stemming from HST-related tax refunds passed on by
"businesses, the introduction of the HST in July 2010 has temporarily boosted reported total CPI inflation"
"but reduced reported core inflation. The latter effect, estimated at -0.3 percentage points, is expected to"
unwind by the end of 2011.
The expected recovery in Canadian
exports is now projected to be even
more muted
The Bank expects core inflation to
remain around 2 per cent

"Each quarter, the Bank’s regional offi"
ces consult
with businesses to gauge their views on economic
activity over the next 12 months. When probed
about the factors underpinning their sales expecta-
tions in the most recent Business Outlook Survey
"(BOS), many fi"
rms indicated that the high level of the
Canadian dollar is creating headwinds.1
Nearly half of the fi
rms in the summer 2011 survey
reported adverse impacts on their business from
the appreciation of the Canadian dollar. As shown in
"Chart 1-A, these fi"
rms tend to have lower balances
of opinion across indicators of real business activity
"—future sales growth, investment and employment."
"Overall, fi"
rms citing negative effects from the strong
dollar were most often based in Central and Eastern
Canada.
Firms that indicated experiencing adverse effects
from the appreciation of the Canadian dollar cited
"different reasons. In some cases, the negative"
impacts stemmed largely from lower profi
t margins.
"In other cases, fi"
rms reported that the higher dollar
was dampening their expectations for sales growth
over the next 12 months. Reports of adverse effects
on sales prospects were most common among
manufacturers (Chart 1-B) and among exporting
fi
rms focusing primarily on the United States as their
main export market.
The dampening effects of Canadian-dollar head-
winds on fi
rms’ sales expectations were also evident
when the exchange rate appreciated to above parity
in late 2007. While in 2007 the dollar headwinds
contributed to a view that sales growth would slow
"over the coming year, in the 2011 survey, negatively"
affected fi
rms still expected their sales growth
"1 Each quarter, the Bank’s regional offi"
ces carry out interviews with
about 100 fi
rms for the Business Outlook Survey. The face-to-face for-
mat of the interviews allows the Bank’s regional offi
ces to probe busi-
nesses on factors underpinning and infl
uencing their outlook (see “The
"Bank of Canada’s Business Outlook Survey” by Monica Martin, Bank of"
"Canada Review, Spring 2004). A broad set of supplemental questions"
on the appreciation of the Canadian dollar was asked over several
surveys between autumn 2003 and winter 2004-05 and summarized in
"the Autumn 2005 Bank of Canada Review article by Jean Mair, “How"
the Appreciation of the Canadian Dollar Has Affected Canadian Firms:

for agricultural commodities on food prices in Canada are also expected to
put further upward pressure on core inflation through the second half of
"2011, with this impact unwinding through 2012, thus contributing to the"
stabilization of core inflation at 2 per cent. Slightly firmer prices for core
services are expected to have a more persistent effect on core inflation.
The high level of the Canadian dollar is expected to continue to help
dampen inflationary pressures.
"In coming quarters, total CPI inflation is projected to fall from its recently"
"elevated level, partly because of the unwinding of the impact of the intro­"
duction of the HST in July 2010 on the year-over-year rate of inflation. In
"addition, energy prices have fallen from their peak, and are projected to be"
"relatively stable going forward, rising only modestly. As a result, total CPI"
inflation is still expected to converge to core inflation at the 2 per cent target
by the middle of 2012.
This projection includes a gradual reduction in monetary stimulus over the
"projection horizon, consistent with achieving the inflation target (Technical"
Box 2).
The uncertainty surrounding the Bank’s inflation projection is illustrated
using fan charts. Chart 29 and Chart 30 depict the 50 per cent and 90 per
cent confidence bands for year-over-year core inflation and total CPI infla­
tion from the third quarter of 2011 to the end of 2013.

The Bank of Canada uses the target overnight rate to
stabilize infl
ation at the 2 per cent target. By raising or
lowering the target for the overnight rate (the policy
"rate), the Bank infl"
"uences other interest rates, such as"
"those for consumer loans and mortgages and, poten-"
"tially, the exchange rate. These rates ultimately affect"
economic activity and infl
ation.
"In the long run, once the effects of all current and"
past economic headwinds and tailwinds have fully
"dissipated, CPI infl"
ation can be expected to equal
"(and remain at) the 2 per cent target, output can be"
expected to equal (and remain at) the economy’s pro-
"duction potential, and the target overnight rate can be"
expected to equal (and remain at) its long-run level.
"Over the shorter run, monetary policy can be used"
to offset the expected ongoing impact of economic
headwinds or tailwinds on infl
ation and output. In
"these cases, the policy rate will need to deviate"
from its long-run level to provide the stimulus or
restraint necessary to offset these headwinds or
tailwinds and return infl
ation to the target.
"For instance, if the Bank judges that the Canadian"
economy will experience headwinds owing to a
persistent reduction in demand for its exports
"(such as from a foreign demand shock), it can"
offset the expected ongoing impact on overall GDP
and infl
ation via an appropriately stimulative path
"for the policy rate. Conversely, if the economy were"
"experiencing tailwinds stemming from, for instance,"
a persistent fi
nancial shock (that results in
"unusually narrow risk spreads), the Bank may judge"
it appropriate to maintain a suffi
ciently high level
"for the policy rate, relative to its long-run level,"
in order to offset the expected infl
ationary implica-
tions of the shock.
"1 In either case, the Bank must"
make a judgment regarding the most appropriate
horizon over which to return infl
ation to the 2 per
cent target.
"The key message is that, in general, the policy rate"
can deviate from its long-run level even if infl
ation is
at target and output is at potential. In the context of
a projection for infl
"ation, this implies that the policy"
rate can return to its long-run level after infl
ation is
projected to reach the 2 per cent target and output
1 The particular shocks discussed here are for illustrative purposes only.
Real and fi
nancial shocks can both act as headwinds or tailwinds to the
economy.

"Headwinds, Tailwinds and the Policy Rate"
is projected to reach its potential. This contrasts
with the assumption that the policy rate should
always be at its long-run level when infl
ation is at
target and the output gap is closed.
Figure 2-A and Figure 2-B plot the hypothetical
responses of infl
"ation, the output gap and the target"
overnight rate to a negative foreign demand shock.
Figure 2-A illustrates the case of a simple Taylor-type
rule
2 where the overnight rate mechanically responds
to deviations of current infl
ation from the target. In
"this scenario, infl"
"ation returns to target, output returns"
to its potential and the overnight rate returns to its
2 A Taylor-type rule specifi
es policy in terms of current infl
ation and the
estimated current level of the output gap.
"long-run level, all at the same time, after the effects"
of the headwinds have fully dissipated.
Figure 2-B illustrates the more desirable case where
the central bank takes better account of the expected
headwinds from the sustained decline in foreign
demand. The central bank leans more heavily into
the headwinds by maintaining interest rates further
"below their long-run level, which more fully offsets"
the effects of weaker foreign demand
3 on the
domestic economy. This allows infl
ation to return
more quickly to the target (and stay there) and
"output to potential, before the policy rate returns to"
"its long-run level, as illustrated."
3 Lags in the transmission of monetary policy may prevent the central
bank from fully offsetting the initial impact of a shock on infl
ation.

RISKS TO THE OUTLOOK
BANK OF CANADA    MONETARY POLICY REPORT    JULY 2011 31
"Although the global outlook remains broadly unchanged, global risks have"
"intensified, most notably in Europe."
The three main upside risks to inflation in Canada relate to the possibility
"of higher-than-projected commodity prices and global inflation, stronger"
"momentum in Canadian household spending, and the possibility that there"
is less excess capacity in the Canadian economy.

 If efforts to restrain excess demand and mounting inflation pressures in
"emerging-market economies prove unsuccessful, commodity prices and"
"global inflation could rise much faster than projected, raising incomes in"
Canada through higher export prices and increasing pressures on
domestic prices.

 There could be stronger-than-expected momentum in household expendi­
"tures in Canada. With very stimulative financing conditions, borrowing"
could grow faster than income.

 The economy’s production potential could be lower than estimated. While
"labour market indicators still point to significant slack, some indicators of"
capacity pressures suggest that the economy may be operating closer to
its production potential.
The three main downside risks to inflation in Canada relate to sovereign debt
"concerns in Europe, headwinds from the persistent strength of the Canadian"
dollar and the possibility that growth in household spending could be weaker
than projected.

 Acute fiscal and financial strains in Europe could trigger a generalized
retrenchment from risk-taking and severe dislocations in global funding
markets.

 The persistent strength of the Canadian dollar could create even greater
"headwinds for the Canadian economy, putting additional downward pres­"
sure on inflation through weaker-than-expected net exports and larger
declines in import prices.

 High household debt levels in Canada could lead to a sharper-than-
"expected deceleration in household spending. Relatedly, if there were a"
"sudden weakening in the Canadian housing sector, it could have sizable"
spillover effects on other areas of the economy.
"Overall, the Bank judges that the risks to the inflation outlook in Canada are"
roughly balanced over the projection horizon.
