Canada’s infl
ation-control strategy
Infl
ation targeting and the economy
""

The objective of Canada’s monetary policy is to promote the
economic and fi
nancial well-being of Canadians. Canada’s
experience with infl
ation targeting since 1991 has shown that the
best way that monetary policy can achieve this goal is by maintaining
a low and stable infl
ation environment. Doing so fosters confi
dence
"in the value of money and contributes to sustained economic growth,"
a strong and inclusive labour market and improved living standards.
""

"In 2021, the Government of Canada and the Bank of Canada"
renewed the fl
exible infl
ation-targeting strategy of the monetary policy
framework for a further fi
"ve-year period, ending December 31, 2026.1"
""

The infl
ation target was renewed at the 2% midpoint of the 1%–3%
"control range, with infl"
ation measured as the 12-month rate of
change in the consumer price index (CPI).
""

The Government and the Bank agreed that the best contribution
monetary policy can make to the economic and fi
nancial
well-being of Canadians is to continue to focus on price stability.
The Government and the Bank also agreed that monetary policy
"should continue to support maximum sustainable employment,"
recognizing that maximum sustainable employment is not directly
measurable and is determined largely by non-monetary factors
that can change through time.
""

"Further, the Government and the Bank agreed that because well-"
anchored infl
ation expectations are critical to achieving both price
"stability and maximum sustainable employment, the primary objective"
"of monetary policy is to maintain low, stable infl"
ation over time.
Infl
ation targeting is symmetric and ﬂ
exible
""

Canada’s infl
"ation-targeting approach is symmetric, which means"
the Bank is equally concerned about infl
ation rising above or falling
below the 2% target.
""

Canada’s infl
ation-targeting approach is also ﬂ
"exible. Typically,"
the Bank seeks to return infl
ation to target over a horizon of six to
"eight quarters. However, the most appropriate horizon for returning"
infl
ation to target will vary depending on the nature and persistence
of the shocks buffeting the economy.
""

The 2021 agreement with the Government specifi
es that the 2%
infl
ation target remains the cornerstone of the framework.
""

The agreement further notes that the Bank will continue to use the
fl
exibility of the 1%–3% control range to actively seek the maximum
"sustainable level of employment, when conditions warrant. The Bank"
will also continue to leverage the fl
exibility inherent in the framework
to help address the challenges of structurally low interest rates by
using a broad set of policy tools. The Bank will use this fl
exibility only
to an extent that is consistent with keeping medium-term infl
ation
expectations well anchored at 2%.
Monetary policy tools
""

Because monetary policy actions take time to work their way through
the economy and have their full effect on infl
"ation, monetary policy"
must be forward-looking.
""

The Bank normally carries out monetary policy through changes
in the target for the overnight rate of interest (the policy rate). The
Bank also has a range of monetary policy tools it can use when the
policy rate is at very low levels. These tools consist of guidance on
"the future evolution of the policy rate, large-scale asset purchases"
"(quantitative easing and credit easing), funding for credit measures,"
and negative policy rates. The potential use and sequencing of these
tools would depend on the economic and fi
nancial market context.
""

All of the Bank’s monetary policy tools affect total demand for
Canadian goods and services through their infl
uence on market
"interest rates, domestic asset prices and the exchange rate. The"
balance between this demand and the economy’s production
"capacity is, over time, the main factor that determines infl"
ation
pressures in the economy.
Communications
""

"Consistent with its commitment to clear, transparent communications,"
the Bank regularly reports its perspectives on the economy and
infl
ation. Policy decisions are typically announced on eight pre-set
"days during the year, and full updates to the Bank’s outlook are"
published four times each year in the Monetary Policy Report.
""

The Bank is committed to explaining when it is using the fl
exibility of
the infl
ation-targeting strategy.
""

Given the uncertainty about the maximum sustainable level of
"employment, the Bank will consider a broad range of labour market"
indicators. The Bank will also systematically report to Canadians on
how labour market outcomes have factored into its policy decisions.
Monitoring infl
ation
""

"In the short run, the prices of certain CPI components can be"
particularly volatile and can cause sizable fl
uctuations in CPI infl
ation.
""

"In setting monetary policy, the Bank seeks to look through such"
transitory movements in CPI infl
ation and focuses on “core” infl
ation
measures that better refl
ect the underlying trend of infl
ation. In this
"sense, these measures act as an operational guide to help the Bank"
achieve the CPI infl
ation target. They are not a replacement for CPI
infl
ation.
""

The Bank’s two preferred measures of core infl
"ation are CPI-trim,"
which excludes CPI components whose rates of change in a given
"month are the most extreme, and CPI-median, which corresponds"
to the price change located at the 50th percentile (in terms of basket
weight) of the distribution of price changes.

Overview
Overview
Inflation continues to decline gradually in most economies. Higher policy
interest rates and tight financial conditions are contributing to slowing global
"demand growth and easing price pressures, although inflation in services"
prices is sticky.
Global economic growth is slowing. While the US economy has been
"surprisingly robust, the weakness in China has been more pronounced than"
expected in the July Report.
"In Canada, higher interest rates are working to ease price pressures, and"
consumer price index (CPI) inflation has come down significantly from its
"peak in June 2022. However, progress toward the 2% target is proving to"
"be slow, and the pace of future declines in inflation remains uncertain. Core"
inflation has been more persistent than expected.
"At the same time, demand growth has eased and supply is rising. Evidence"
suggests that the economy is approaching balance. With supply growing faster
"than demand, price pressures are expected to gradually moderate further."
"Economic activity is forecast to be modest through most of 2024, with annual"
growth in gross domestic product (GDP) just under 1%. As past interest rate
"increases continue to work their way through the economy, they will weigh"
on household spending and business investment. Weak foreign demand is
also expected to slow export growth. GDP growth is projected to rise to about
2½% in 2025.
Inflation is now projected to stay around 3½% until the middle of 2024. As the
"economy moves into excess supply and price pressures moderate, inflation is"
forecast to ease to about 2½% in the second half of 2024 and then return to
target in 2025.
A considerable amount of uncertainty surrounds the forecast. Three-month
"rates of core inflation have remained elevated, in the range of 3½% to 4%"
"for the past year. Near-term inflation expectations are still high, and there is"
a risk that they could become a driver of wage- and price-setting behaviour.
Another risk is that the war in Israel and Gaza spreads further into a broader
"regional conflict, disrupting oil supplies and leading to a resurgence of"
inflation in energy prices.
"Overall, there is more evidence that the economy is slowing, which is"
"relieving price pressures. But the progress to price stability is slow, and"
inflationary risks have increased.

"Inflation is easing across most economies. Initially, this largely reflected"
"falling energy prices. More recently, the decline in inflation in advanced"
economies has been led by slower growth in the prices of non-energy goods
and shelter. Inflation in the prices of services remains elevated and is taking
longer to adjust. Inflation is anticipated to continue its gradual decline as
higher policy interest rates and the recent increases in yields on long-term
"bonds slow demand. However, higher oil prices are slowing the disinflationary"
process and increasing upside risks. Inflation in most major advanced
"economies is now expected to return to central bank targets in 2025,"
although the timing remains uncertain.
"As projected in the July Report, global growth has been slowing and is forecast"
"to ease further. The composition of global growth, however, has shifted"
"(Table 1 and Box 1).1 For 2023, economic growth in the United States—"
Canada’s largest trading partner—is now expected to be stronger than
"previously anticipated, while growth for China has been revised down."

Slowing inflation
Falling energy prices lowered inflation rates across most regions over the
"first half of the year (Chart 1). More recently, slower growth in prices for both"
non-energy goods and shelter has contributed more to declining inflation than
energy has. Inflation in services prices excluding shelter has been slow to adjust.
Inflation in non-energy goods prices has been easing because of supply
"and demand factors. On the supply side, pressures from global supply chain"
"bottlenecks have lessened. At the same time, past increases in interest rates"
and a shift in spending patterns back toward high-contact services have
slowed the demand for goods (Chart 2).
Box 1
Changes to the economic projection since the July Report
Global outlook
The outlook for global growth is largely unchanged from
"the July Report, but some compositional differences are"
relevant for the Canadian outlook:
""
 The outlook for growth in 2023 in the United States
has been revised up. Consumption and investment
spending have been growing faster than expected in
"the July Report, supported by a stronger outlook for"
"labour force participation and employment. However,"
long-term bond yields have increased sharply since
"July, and the higher levels are expected to persist."
The associated tightening in fi
nancial conditions
"limits the extent of the revision, leaving the growth"
outlook for 2024 and 2025 broadly the same as in
the July Report.
""
 The growth outlook for 2023 in China has been
revised down. China’s property developers are
experiencing renewed fi
nancial strain. This stress
in the property sector is weighing further on
"economic sentiment, adding to pressures in the"
broader fi
nancial system and slowing credit growth.
"As a result, domestic demand growth has slowed."
Targeted policy actions are expected to keep growth
in 2024 and 2025 roughly unchanged from the
outlook in the July Report.
Canadian outlook
Supply and demand in the Canadian economy are now
"closer to balance, but infl"
ationary pressures are more
persistent than expected:
""
 Growth in gross domestic product (GDP) in the
second quarter of 2023 was well below expectations.
Household spending—both consumption and
housing—was weaker than anticipated. Forest fi
res
and the Public Service Alliance of Canada strike also
had a bigger negative impact than originally estimated.
""
 The outlook for GDP over 2024 has been revised
down because of weaker consumption and
housing spending. This weakness is due to a
more prolonged impact from past monetary policy
tightening and higher long-term interest rates.
Table 2 and Table 3 on page 11 present the
revisions to the forecast for GDP growth.
""
 Potential output has been revised down slightly over
"the projection horizon, refl"
ecting ongoing weakness
in productivity. Unexpected strength in population
"growth has provided a partial offset. Overall, the"
projection now begins with the economy being in a
situation of slight excess supply and remaining in
excess supply throughout the forecast.
""
 The outlook for consumer price index infl
ation
through to the end of 2024 has been revised
up. About half of this revision refl
ects the higher
assumption for oil prices. Shelter price infl
ation has
"also increased, and underlying infl"
ationary pressures
are more persistent than expected. Elevated infl
ation
"expectations, corporate pricing behaviour and strong"
wage growth have also kept underlying infl
ationary
pressures higher than expected.

"Shelter price inflation, though generally still high, is now declining in most"
"advanced economies. This is expected to reduce overall inflation, but the"
extent of the impact will likely vary across countries. This variation is partly
due to differences in how national price indexes measure housing costs
"(Box 2). In the United States, shelter costs are expected to be a significant"
driver of falling inflation in 2024 because rent is not rising as sharply as before.

"Strong demand, tight labour markets and the impact of businesses’ inflation"
expectations on their price-setting behaviour are hindering the adjustment
"of inflation in services prices, particularly in the United States. As a result,"
prices of services are expected to adjust gradually as tight monetary
"conditions slow demand. Overall, inflation is expected to be close to central"
bank targets across most major advanced economies in 2025.

Box 2
Diﬀ
erences in shelter price infl
ation across advanced economies
Many advanced economies have experienced large
movements in shelter price infl
ation over the last few years
(Chart 2-A). After a modest decline during the fi
rst year
"of the COVID-19 pandemic, shelter price infl"
ation rose
rapidly starting in 2021. It has peaked in most economies
but remains well above the pre-pandemic trend.
These recent movements in shelter price infl
ation
have varied widely across countries. This is due to
differences in economic conditions in each country
and the way shelter costs are measured in a country’s
"consumer price index (CPI). In general, shelter price"
infl
ation in most advanced economies includes two key
components: rental price infl
ation and owner-occupied
housing (OOH) price infl
ation.
Measures of rental price infl
ation are often based on
"survey responses, though the exact method to calculate"
"this measure varies from country to country. In Canada,"
information in the CPI is updated monthly based
"on survey responses. In the United States, survey"
responses are gradually phased into the CPI over
"six months. As a result, changes in rent prices in the"
US market show up slowly in offi
cial measures and the
effects on infl
ation tend to be persistent.
For OOH price infl
"ation, three approaches stand out"
among advanced economies:
""
" In Canada and Sweden, OOH price infl"
ation is
calculated using a variation of a user cost approach.
This method estimates the direct cost of owning and
"occupying a home. As a result, it includes both out-of-"
"pocket expenses—such as mortgage interest, home"
repairs and insurance—and implicit costs that a
"homeowner would normally incur, like depreciation."
""
" Other countries, such as the United States,"
calculate OOH price infl
ation using a rental
equivalence approach. This method estimates the
market price that homeowners would pay to rent
similar accommodations. These countries do not
explicitly include mortgage interest costs in their
shelter price indexes.
""
 Australia and New Zealand use a net acquisitions
"approach, which is based on the cost of purchasing"
"newly built properties, excluding the value of the"
land. These countries also do not explicitly include
mortgage interest costs in their shelter price indexes.
The weight of shelter costs varies across different CPI
baskets. Shelter costs comprise roughly one-quarter of
the basket in Canada and range from about one-tenth
to one-third in other advanced economies (Table 2-A).
One major reason for this difference is that OOH is
excluded from the CPIs tracked by several major central
"banks, such as the Bank of England and the European"
Central Bank.

Tighter financial conditions
Global financial conditions have tightened since the July Report. Most
"notably, yields on long-term bonds have seen a sharp rise (Chart 3 and"
"Box 1). A number of factors could explain why yields have risen, and"
"separating out their contributions is difficult. First, real yields have increased,"
due in part to market expectations that policy rates will remain higher for
"longer. Second, the term premium has risen, reflecting increased market"
uncertainty about how high policy interest rates may rise and how long
"they may remain elevated. Third, factors such as the large fiscal deficit in"
"the United States and high issuance of government debt globally, amid soft"
"demand for such assets, may also be playing a role. Finally, the rise in long-"
term interest rates may reflect the market’s reassessment of the neutral
rate of interest. The Canadian dollar has been broadly stable against the
"US dollar this year (Chart 4), although it has appreciated against a basket of"
other currencies.

"Resilient US demand, sluggishness in China"
The US economy has grown robustly since mid-2022. Consumption has
been supported by strong employment growth and households spending
their savings accumulated during the COVID-19 pandemic. Strong consumer
demand and an easing of supply constraints have boosted investment.
Growth is expected to decelerate over the coming quarters and remain weak
in 2024. This is largely due to the impact of past interest rate increases and
the recent tightening of overall financial conditions. Growth is projected to
pick up in 2025 as the impact of past monetary policy tightening eases.
"In contrast, growth in China slowed sharply in the second quarter of 2023"
after the strong reopening effects observed in the first quarter dissipated.
"More recently, problems in China’s property sector have intensified anew,"
leading to increased uncertainty and subdued sentiment. Foreign demand
"for China’s exports is also growing at a slower pace, and export prices have"
been falling.
"In the euro area, growth remains sluggish. Recent data point to a slowdown"
in the second half of this year as the impact of past interest rate increases
and the tightening in financial conditions restrain growth. Growth is projected
to pick up gradually over 2024 and 2025 as the effects of past energy shocks
and monetary tightening fade.
Higher oil prices
Global oil prices have fluctuated around a higher level than assumed in
the July Report. Prices rose sharply after Saudi Arabia and Russia cut oil
"production and exports. Subsequently, the war in Israel and Gaza has led to"
fresh concerns about oil supplies. The per-barrel price of Brent oil is assumed
"to be US$90 throughout the projection, which is US$10 higher than assumed"
in the July Report (Box 3).

BANK OF CANADA  •  Monetary Policy Report  •  October 2023
Non-energy commodity prices are modestly lower than assumed in the July
"Report. The decline primarily reflects agricultural prices, which have broadly"
fallen because favourable weather has improved harvest forecasts. Lumber
prices have also declined because weak housing activity across North
America is weighing on demand.
Box 3
Key inputs to the projection
The Bank of Canada’s projection is conditional on
several key inputs and assumptions about their future
path. The Bank regularly reviews these assumptions
and adjusts the economic projection accordingly. The
key inputs to the Bank’s projection are as follows:
""
" Over the projection horizon, the per-barrel prices"
for oil in US dollars are assumed to be $90 for
"Brent, $85 for West Texas Intermediate and $70 for"
Western Canadian Select. These prices are all $10
higher than in the July Report.
""
" By convention, the Bank does not forecast the"
exchange rate in the Monetary Policy Report. The
Canadian dollar is assumed to remain at 74 cents
"US over the projection horizon, close to its recent"
average and 1 cent lower than the assumption in the
July Report.
""
 Potential output growth in Canada is expected to
increase from 1.6% in 2022 to about 2% per year
over the projection horizon as labour productivity
growth picks up from subdued levels.
""
 Real gross domestic product (GDP) is estimated
to have grown by about 0.8% in the third quarter of
"2023, below potential output growth. As a result,"
the Bank estimates that the output gap is between
-0.75% and 0.25% in the third quarter.
""

"The output gap for the second quarter, estimated"
"to be between 0% and 1% in July, has been"
revised down in this Report. The range for the
second quarter is now between -0.25% and
"0.75%, 0.25 percentage points lower, refl"
ecting
weaker-than-expected GDP growth in the fi
rst
half of 2023 (Table 3 on page 11).
""
 The projection incorporates information from all
provincial and federal budgets available at the time
of writing.
""
 The nominal neutral interest rate in Canada is
estimated to be in the range of 2% to 3%. The
economic projection assumes that the neutral rate
is at the midpoint of this range. The nominal neutral
interest rate is defi
ned as the real neutral rate plus
2% for infl
ation. The real neutral rate is the rate
consistent with both output remaining sustainably
at its potential and infl
ation remaining at target
on an ongoing basis. It is a medium- to long-term
equilibrium concept.

BANK OF CANADA  •  Monetary Policy Report  •  October 2023
Canadian economy
Canadian economy
CPI inflation has dropped significantly from its peak of 8.1% in June 2022.
"More recently, it has fluctuated between 2.8% and 4.0%. Although price"
"pressures are easing for some goods and services, core inflation is proving"
to be more stubborn than anticipated.
"Past interest rate increases are working through the economy, slowing demand"
"and gradually reducing price pressures. Inflation expectations have eased,"
"but they continue to be above the Bank’s forecast for inflation. Moreover,"
"businesses are still able to easily pass on cost increases, and wage growth"
"remains strong. As a result, progress toward the inflation target has been slow."
"Inflation is still expected to ease steadily, but uncertainty about the pace"
toward the 2% target remains elevated.
Past interest rate increases slowing demand
Growing evidence shows that past interest rate increases are working to bring
demand and supply back into balance (Box 4). GDP growth has averaged
"1% over the past year, lower than the rate of potential output growth (Table 2,"
Box 4
Charting monetary policy’s impact on the economy and infl
ation
The Bank of Canada has raised interest rates signifi
cantly
since March 2022. The most immediate impact has been
an increase in the cost of new or existing debt. Mortgage
credit growth slowed from 9.9% on an annualized three-
month basis in February 2022 to 3.5% in August 2023.
Monetary policy has also slowed demand growth by
encouraging households to spend less and save more.1
Higher interest rates take time to work—they affect
demand fi
rst and then infl
ation.
Soft
er household spending
The rise in interest rates has cooled demand for housing
"and big-ticket items.2 Since February 2022, housing"
resales have declined by 33% and house prices by
about 10%.
"1 For more details, see the Canadian Survey of Consumer Expectations—"
Third Quarter of 2023.
2 Other key factors lowering demand include normalization of spending
"following the pandemic boom (for example, purchases of furniture and"
appliances) and adjustments to spending due to high infl
ation.
"Consumption per capita has stalled (Chart 4-A), mainly"
due to weakness in spending on goods and services
that are sensitive to interest rates (Chart 4-B).3 As the
effects of higher interest rates continue to work their
"way through the economy, spending on other goods"
and services is also slowing. For 85% of categories of
"consumer spending, the pace of growth has decelerated."
The notable exception is purchases of motor vehicles.
Consumers were unable to purchase motor vehicles
due to a lack of supply resulting from the semiconductor
shortages that began early in the COVID-19 pandemic.
The recent increase in purchases likely refl
ects improved
supply combined with pent-up demand.
3 The main reason for the weakness in per capita consumption has been the
"slowdown in spending, not the recent population boom."

Box 4 (continued)
"Since the beginning of 2023, average job gains have"
also slowed in sectors that are sensitive to changes
"in interest rates, including construction as well as"
"information, culture and recreation services."
Impact of past tightening on business
investment
"Since mid-2022, growth in business investment has"
been modest. This situation masks two opposing forces.
"On the upside, investment in engineering structures"
"is rising steadily, largely reﬂ"
ecting higher oil prices
and major projects related to energy transportation. In
"contrast, investment in machinery and equipment has"
fallen by about 10%. According to results from business
"surveys, many ﬁ"
rms mentioned the negative effects of
elevated borrowing costs and tight credit conditions as
key reasons for their moderate capital expenditures.
Disinﬂ
ation in some categories of the consumer
price index
Tighter monetary policy is softening demand and has
thus contributed to slowing inﬂ
ation over the past year.
"Despite considerable volatility in the data, several"
categories have seen drops in inﬂ
ation rates:
""
Durable goods price inﬂ
ation excluding purchases
"of vehicles has fallen from 5.4% to -0.4%, and semi-"
durable goods inﬂ
ation has dropped from 4.3% to
2.1%.4 The easing of supply chain issues has also
contributed to slower inﬂ
ation of goods prices.
""
Homeowners’ replacement cost inﬂ
ation has fallen
from a peak of 14.4% at the height of housing
demand to -1.1%.
""
Inﬂ
ation in services prices excluding shelter has
slowed from 5.1% to 1.5%.
An exception is inﬂ
ation in prices of non-durable goods
(excluding food in stores and energy). This category
"includes items such as personal care goods, cleaning"
products and paper supplies. Despite the slowdown in
"demand, inﬂ"
ation in this category remains close to 6%.
4 The annualized rate of growth in per capita consumption of semi-durable
goods has dropped from over 6% before the start of the tightening cycle to
"-2% since the second quarter of 2022. As well, per capita consumption of"
"durable goods was already falling before the rate increases, but the pace"
of the decline has accelerated since the increases began. Consumption of
furniture and household appliances are good examples of this dynamic.

Table 3 and Chart 5). Economic activity was flat in the second quarter of
"2023, with some of this weakness due to temporary factors such as wildfires"
and the strikes in the public sector.
Higher interest rates have contributed to softening demand for housing
and many durable goods as well as slowing household credit growth.
"Demand growth has also moderated for many services, such as recreation,"
"restaurants and accommodation. Overall, per capita GDP growth has been"
"negative, falling by 1.6% over the past year."
"As interest rates have increased, measures of household financial stress"
"have risen from the lows observed during the height of the pandemic. To date,"
"indicators of financial stress point mainly to non-mortgage holders. For example,"
although delinquency rates for mortgage products have remained close to their
"all-time lows, the share of borrowers falling behind on payments by 60 days"
"or more has continued to increase for most credit products. In particular,"
delinquency rates for motor vehicle loans have surpassed pre-pandemic levels.

Rebalancing of supply and demand
"With slowing demand growth and rising supply, a variety of indicators"
suggest that the economy is approaching balance.
Excess demand pressures have been easing. The output gap is now
estimated to be between ‑0.75% and 0.25% in the third quarter of 2023. As is
"typical at this point in the business cycle, there are mixed signals about the"
"balance of supply and demand. Moreover, the recovery from the pandemic"
shock makes it harder than usual to assess the level of excess demand in the
"economy, so uncertainty is greater than normal."
"In the labour market, job gains slowed to an average of around 32,000 per month"
"in the third quarter, below the pace consistent with labour force growth. The"
Bank’s business surveys also suggest that the economy is moving closer
to balance. Businesses have seen indicators of capacity pressures fall from
"high levels, and their hiring and investment plans have been trending down."
"In the Business Outlook Survey (BOS) for the third quarter of 2023, the share"
of businesses reporting binding labour shortages has returned close to its
historical average.
"Other labour market indicators, however, point to modest excess demand."
"While job vacancies have eased significantly over the past year, they have"
not yet returned to pre-pandemic levels. The unemployment rate has risen
in recent months but remains low (Chart 6). Consistent with a tight labour
"market, wage pressures are elevated and reports of shortages of skilled"
workers are widespread (Chart 7).

Persistent inflationary pressures
CPI inflation in Canada declined from a peak of 8.1% in 2022 and has been
"volatile in recent months, ranging from 2.8% to 4.0%. Initially, the decline was"
due to falling energy prices and improvements in global supply chains. More
"recently, higher interest rates have led to a better balance between supply"
"and demand. The impact on inflation is materializing, albeit more slowly than"
expected.

"In recent months, higher oil prices have boosted energy price inflation,"
"especially for gasoline (Chart 8). Shelter price inflation has also picked up,"
"with a three-month rate of 8.0%. It has also become more broad-based,"
with rent and other accommodation expenses increasing in addition to the
"ongoing rise in mortgage interest costs (Box 2). In previous cycles, when"
"the contribution from mortgage interest costs has gone up, the impact on"
shelter inflation has been mitigated by lower inflation in house price–related
"components. However, recently, structural supply challenges have limited this"
offset and put upward pressure on other shelter components (Chart 9).

"At the same time, progress toward lower inflation continues for other"
subcomponents of the CPI. Three-month inflation for food purchased from
"stores has fallen to 3.9%, and growth in input costs has eased. Inflation for"
goods excluding energy and food from stores has also moderated because
"demand for these goods has diminished. Likewise, inflation for services"
"excluding shelter has declined as the economy has slowed. Moreover, while"
larger-than-normal price increases remain widespread across goods and
"services, the breadth has narrowed considerably (Chart 10)."
"Some of the subcomponents of the CPI show indications of improvement, but"
overall progress toward lower inflation has been slower than anticipated.
Core inflation has not declined as much as expected. It has made little
progress after falling on a year-over-year basis from just over 5% in 2022 to
just under 4% in mid-2023 (Chart 11). This is consistent with the three-month
rates (Chart 12):

"As excess demand eases, inflation is expected to slow. At the same time,"
"inflation expectations should also fall, businesses’ pricing behaviour should"

"Near-term inflation expectations have eased, but they remain elevated and"
above the Bank’s inflation forecast (Chart 13). Results from the BOS for the
third quarter of 2023 show that businesses expect the annual rate of inflation
to average between 3% and 3.5% over the next two years. Consumers’
"inflation expectations also remain higher than they were before the pandemic,"
averaging 5% over the next year and 4% for the year beyond that.2 Long-term
expectations remain consistent with the 2% target.
Corporate pricing behaviour has yet to normalize. Businesses continue
to increase prices more frequently and by a larger amount than normal
"(Chart 14). This may indicate that households and businesses are,"
"respectively, expecting to pay more and charge more for goods and services."
High inflation expectations could also feed into wages.
"2	 Consumers’ perceptions of current inflation, as reported in the Canadian Survey of Consumer"
"Expectations—Third Quarter of 2023, are on average about 0.5 percentage points higher than actual"
CPI inflation. This gap has grown unusually wide in recent quarters. Even as CPI inflation has declined
"by 4.3 percentage points from its peak in mid-2022, consumers’ perceptions of current inflation have"
fallen by only 1.4 percentage points. This could be related to consumers’ sensitivity to components such
as food and shelter.

Slow demand growth and rising supply
"Economic growth is expected to remain muted, averaging less than 1.0%"
over the next several quarters. The effects of past increases in interest
"rates and, more recently, tighter global financial conditions are expected"
to continue to weigh on consumption and business investment spending.
Results from the BOS for the third quarter point to weakening sales growth in
"the next year (Chart 15), particularly for those businesses that are the most"
"sensitive to interest rates. In addition, slowing foreign demand is anticipated"
"to dampen Canadian export growth over this period. However, spending by"
"government contributes materially to growth, averaging 2.5% through 2024,"
somewhat above potential output growth.
"With demand continuing to grow more slowly than potential output, the"
economy is projected to move into modest excess supply in the fourth quarter
"of 2023, and excess supply increases through most of 2024."
"GDP growth is expected to pick up at the end of 2024, rising to around"
2.5% in 2025 (Chart 16) and this begins to reduce excess supply in the
economy. Household spending on a per capita basis is weak in 2024. It then
strengthens as the effects of monetary policy tightening on growth fades.
Exports and business investment are supported by the recovery in foreign
demand.
Potential output growth is estimated to average about 2% over the projection
horizon. This estimate reflects solid population growth due to strong
immigration and the ongoing arrival of large numbers of temporary residents.
It also reflects an expected pickup in labour productivity from its current
weakness.

Muted household spending growth
Consumer spending is expected to be subdued through 2024. While
"consumption is supported by strong population growth, on a per capita"
basis it is projected to continue declining through most of 2024. Responses
to the Canadian Survey of Consumer Expectations for the third quarter of
"2023 indicate that households are cutting back on their spending, delaying"
purchases and shifting their savings to higher-rate accounts in response
to the ongoing effects of higher interest rates and the rising cost of living.
"Income growth is also projected to slow as the labour market eases further,"
weighing on the growth in consumption spending.

"In contrast, residential investment is expected to start recovering in late"
2023 from its recent lows as the boost to construction from strong demand
outweighs the waning effects of higher interest rates.
Soft business investment and export growth
Business investment is expected to remain weak for the rest of 2023 before
picking up gradually in 2024. Investment is being held back by elevated
"borrowing costs, tight credit conditions, the prospect of slowing economic"
activity and the winding down of large infrastructure projects. It begins to pick
up in the second half of 2024 as demand improves and the drag from higher
interest rates fades.
"After a strong start to 2023, export growth is expected to stall over the rest"
of 2023 and 2024 due to softening foreign demand for non-commodity
"exports. Exports are anticipated to pick up in 2025, with the recovery in"
foreign demand and increased energy transportation capacity following the
completion of the Trans Mountain Pipeline Expansion project.
Growth in imports is projected to remain modest through the first half of
2024. It is expected to pick up over the second half of 2024 and 2025 due to
strengthening domestic demand.
"Inflation high in the near term, easing in 2025"
"CPI inflation is projected to remain persistently high, at roughly 3½%, until"
the middle of 2024. Energy prices no longer pull inflation down and instead
add some upward pressure (Chart 17). Shelter price inflation will continue to
"be elevated because of higher mortgage interest costs, rent and other housing"
costs. The strength in rent and other housing costs is partly due to strong
"housing demand, which is supported by rapid population growth, and a structural"
"lack of housing supply. Unlike in previous cycles, rising mortgage interest costs"
are not mitigated significantly by weakness in other shelter components.

These upward pressures on inflation are anticipated to be partially offset by
"the easing of excess demand, weaker pressure from input costs and further"
disinflation in globally traded goods.
Slower growth in input costs is expected to result in further easing in food
price inflation. The three-month rate for food price inflation has slowed and is
well below the latest year-over-year number. This is a signal that food price
inflation will likely ease further in the coming months.
Inflation is projected to fall to around 2.5% in the second half of 2024
"(Chart 18). It then continues to decline, returning to the 2% target in 2025."
Although shelter prices add upward pressure on inflation over the projection
"horizon, shelter price inflation is expected to slow from its current pace."
"Ongoing excess supply in the economy moderates price inflation, helps ease"
inflation expectations and encourages businesses to gradually return to more
normal pricing behaviour.

Risks to the inflation outlook
Risks to the inflation outlook
"As in the July Report, the outlook in the base-case scenario is the most likely"
outcome for inflation. Although the Bank sees both upside and downside
"risks to this outlook, with inflation above target for two years and expected"
"to stay slightly above 3% for an additional year, the Bank is more concerned"
"about upside risks to inflation. Moreover, with progress toward the 2% target"
"slow and increased global risks of higher inflation, the risk that disinflation"
could stall or that inflation even could rise again has increased.
Main upside risks
"As noted in past reports, several upside risks to inflation exist. The inflation"
expectations of households and businesses remain elevated. If these
"expectations do not decline as anticipated, inflation is likely to remain higher"
"than in the base case. Furthermore, businesses may be slower to adjust"
"their pricing behaviour. In addition, if the labour market remains tight or if"
"productivity growth remains weak, cost pressures could be higher and more"
"persistent than projected. Other risks, such as a growing number of extreme"
"weather events affecting harvests and supply chains, could also put upward"
pressure on inflation.
"Some risks have increased since the July Report. Notably, oil prices are"
"higher than expected. So far, the war in Israel and Gaza has not impacted"
"the supply of oil. However, if it were to spread further into a broader regional"
"conflict, global oil supplies could be disrupted and oil prices would rise. Price"
increases could be amplified because current global inventories of oil are
"low. If such a rise in oil prices materializes and is sustained, pass-through to"
"other prices may occur. Inflation could climb sharply, particularly in a context"
in which businesses change prices frequently. Heightened geopolitical
uncertainties may also create new cost pressures by affecting the global
supply chains for goods and raw materials.
Main downside risks
A faster-than-expected slowdown in the Canadian economy is the main
downside risk to inflation. Such a slowing could occur through two main
channels.
"First, the effects of monetary policy could be larger than what is in the base"
"case. With record-high levels of household debt, Canadians could cut back"
consumption spending more than projected. Lower house prices could
exacerbate this decline. Business activities such as investment and hiring
could also slow by more than the Bank expects.
""
Risks to the inflation outlook 	22

BANK OF CANADA  •  Monetary Policy Report  •  October 2023
"Second, global activity could be weaker than in the base case. Monetary"
"policy is tight in most advanced economies, and bond yields have risen"
"sharply in recent weeks, reaching levels not seen since before the 2008–09"
global financial crisis. If the increase in yields proves to be larger or more
"persistent than expected, equity and other asset prices could be negatively"
"impacted further. This, in turn, would weigh on investment and consumption"
"both abroad and in Canada. Moreover, previous episodes of monetary policy"
tightening have occasionally triggered market volatility and capital outflows
"from vulnerable and highly indebted countries, leading to sharp slowdowns in"
global growth. Weaker global demand could reduce prices for commodities
and tradable goods.
Canadian economic growth and inflation would be pulled down if these risks
were to materialize.
