Canada’s infl
ation-control strategy
Infl
ation targeting and the economy
""

The objective of Canada’s monetary policy is to promote the
economic and fi
nancial well-being of Canadians. Canada’s
experience with infl
ation targeting since 1991 has shown that the
best way that monetary policy can achieve this goal is by maintaining
a low and stable infl
ation environment. Doing so fosters confi
dence
"in the value of money and contributes to sustained economic growth,"
a strong and inclusive labour market and improved living standards.
""

"In 2021, the Government of Canada and the Bank of Canada"
renewed the fl
exible infl
ation-targeting strategy of the monetary policy
framework for a further fi
"ve-year period, ending December 31, 2026.1"
""

The infl
ation target was renewed at the 2% midpoint of the 1%–3%
"control range, with infl"
ation measured as the 12-month rate of
change in the consumer price index (CPI).
""

The Government and the Bank agreed that the best contribution
monetary policy can make to the economic and fi
nancial
well-being of Canadians is to continue to focus on price stability.
The Government and the Bank also agreed that monetary policy
"should continue to support maximum sustainable employment,"
recognizing that maximum sustainable employment is not directly
measurable and is determined largely by non-monetary factors
that can change through time.
""

"Further, the Government and the Bank agreed that because well-"
anchored infl
ation expectations are critical to achieving both price
"stability and maximum sustainable employment, the primary objective"
"of monetary policy is to maintain low, stable infl"
ation over time.
Infl
ation targeting is symmetric and ﬂ
exible
""

Canada’s infl
"ation-targeting approach is symmetric, which means"
the Bank is equally concerned about infl
ation rising above or falling
below the 2% target.
""

Canada’s infl
ation-targeting approach is also ﬂ
"exible. Typically,"
the Bank seeks to return infl
ation to target over a horizon of six to
"eight quarters. However, the most appropriate horizon for returning"
infl
ation to target will vary depending on the nature and persistence
of the shocks buffeting the economy.
""

The 2021 agreement with the Government specifi
es that the 2%
infl
ation target remains the cornerstone of the framework.
""

The agreement further notes that the Bank will continue to use the
fl
exibility of the 1%–3% control range to actively seek the maximum
"sustainable level of employment, when conditions warrant. The Bank"
will also continue to leverage the fl
exibility inherent in the framework
to help address the challenges of structurally low interest rates by
using a broad set of policy tools. The Bank will use this fl
exibility only
to an extent that is consistent with keeping medium-term infl
ation
expectations well anchored at 2%.
Monetary policy tools
""

Because monetary policy actions take time to work their way through
the economy and have their full effect on infl
"ation, monetary policy"
must be forward-looking.
""

The Bank normally carries out monetary policy through changes
in the target for the overnight rate of interest (the policy rate). The
Bank also has a range of monetary policy tools it can use when the
policy rate is at very low levels. These tools consist of guidance on
"the future evolution of the policy rate, large-scale asset purchases"
"(quantitative easing and credit easing), funding for credit measures,"
and negative policy rates. The potential use and sequencing of these
tools would depend on the economic and fi
nancial market context.
""

All of the Bank’s monetary policy tools affect total demand for
Canadian goods and services through their infl
uence on market
"interest rates, domestic asset prices and the exchange rate. The"
balance between this demand and the economy’s production
"capacity is, over time, the main factor that determines infl"
ation
pressures in the economy.
Communications
""

"Consistent with its commitment to clear, transparent communications,"
the Bank regularly reports its perspectives on the economy and
infl
ation. Policy decisions are typically announced on eight pre-set
"days during the year, and full updates to the Bank’s outlook are"
published four times each year in the Monetary Policy Report.
""

The Bank is committed to explaining when it is using the fl
exibility of
the infl
ation-targeting strategy.
""

Given the uncertainty about the maximum sustainable level of
"employment, the Bank will consider a broad range of labour market"
indicators.2 The Bank will also systematically report to Canadians on
how labour market outcomes have factored into its policy decisions.
Monitoring infl
ation
""

"In the short run, the prices of certain CPI components can be"
particularly volatile and can cause sizable fl
uctuations in CPI infl
ation.
""

"In setting monetary policy, the Bank seeks to look through such"
transitory movements in CPI infl
ation and focuses on “core” infl
ation
measures that better refl
ect the underlying trend of infl
ation. In this
"sense, these measures act as an operational guide to help the Bank"
achieve the CPI infl
ation target. They are not a replacement for CPI
infl
ation.
""

The Bank’s two preferred measures of core infl
"ation are CPI-trim,"
which excludes CPI components whose rates of change in a given
"month are the most extreme, and CPI-median, which corresponds"
to the price change located at the 50th percentile (in terms of basket
weight) of the distribution of price changes.

Overview
Overview
"Inflation around the world remains high and broad-based, but in many"
"countries it has receded from its peak, largely due to declines in energy"
"prices. With continued easing in global supply chain disruptions, inflation in"
durable goods prices is also moderating.
"Economic activity in advanced economies has been stronger than expected,"
"labour markets remain tight, and core inflation has yet to show sustained"
improvement.
"With inflation still too high, many central banks have continued to increase"
their policy rates to slow demand and bring inflation down.
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine continues to disrupt commodity markets and
affect global economic activity. China’s abrupt lifting of COVID-19 restrictions
poses an upside risk to commodity prices.
"In Canada, higher interest rates are working their way through an overheated"
"economy. It remains in excess demand, and this is putting upward pressure"
"on some domestic prices. The labour market is still tight, and many"
businesses are finding it difficult to attract workers.
"Monetary policy is slowing demand, helping the economy rebalance. Higher"
"interest rates are weighing on household spending, particularly on housing"
and big-ticket items. As the effects of higher interest rates continue to
"spread through the economy, spending on consumer services and business"
"investment is also expected to slow further. As well, weaker foreign demand"
will weigh on exports.
"Growth is expected to stall through the middle of 2023, allowing supply"
"to catch up with demand. On an annual average basis, growth of gross"
domestic product (GDP) is projected to slow to about 1% in 2023.
"With the declines in energy prices, improved global supply chains and a"
"slowdown in demand, consumer price index (CPI) inflation is expected to"
decline significantly this year. CPI inflation is projected to fall to around 3%
in the middle of 2023 and reach the 2% target in 2024.
"With inflation back to target, sustainable growth in the Canadian economy will"
"resume, picking up to about 2% in 2024."

Global economy
Global economy
"Inflation has peaked and is easing in many countries, mainly because of"
"declines in energy prices, improvements in supply chains and lower demand"
"for traded goods. Core inflation, however, has yet to show a sustained"
improvement.
"In advanced economies, labour markets are tight and consumer spending"
"has been robust, particularly in the United States. Russia’s invasion of"
"Ukraine continues to disrupt commodity markets and economic activity,"
hitting European economies especially hard.
Major central banks raised policy interest rates sharply over 2022. While the
"pace of tightening has recently slowed in several countries, some central"
banks have communicated the need for further policy rate increases. Despite
"this, global financial conditions have eased modestly since the time of the"
October Report.
"Global economic activity is stronger than expected, led by consumption in"
many regions. Growth is projected to slow in 2023 to roughly 2% as pent-up
demand from the pandemic fades and the rise in interest rates slows activity.
"Growth is then expected to pick up to about 2½% in 2024, with monetary"
policy still restraining the level of activity (Table 1 and Box 1).

BANK OF CANADA  •  Monetary Policy Report  •  January 2023
"The Bank expects that inflation will decline over the projection, moving"
"closer to central bank targets. Previous drops in commodity prices, a further"
easing of supply challenges and slower demand growth in response to tighter
monetary policy will all exert downward pressure on inflation.
Inflation high but declining
Inflation is coming off multi-decade highs in many countries. But core inflation
has been more persistent (Chart 1).
"In the United States, inflation is projected to continue easing. Inflation in"
goods prices is expected to fall further due to past declines in commodity
"prices, slowing demand and improvements in global supply conditions"
(Chart 2).
"Meanwhile, inflation in services prices has remained strong and broad-"
based. It will take some time for higher interest rates to help bring this down.
"The labour market is tight, labour costs in the services sector are growing"
"strongly, and near-term inflation expectations are high. Inflation in shelter"
"costs should ease earlier than that of other services, given that inflation in"
new rental agreements has already started to decline.1
1	 Inflation in this category adjusts slowly as the stock of leases turns over.
Box 1
Changes to the economic projection since the October Report
Global outlook
The projection for global growth is stronger.
The following factors explain changes to the outlook in
regions important for the Canadian economy:
""
" In the United States, the outlook for 2023 has been"
"revised up, largely because household consumption"
has been stronger than expected. Financial
conditions have also eased.
""
" In the euro area, growth in 2023 is higher than"
"previously projected, refl"
ecting recent strength in
domestic demand. A healthy labour market and
still-elevated household savings have supported
spending. The outlook for core infl
ation is revised
"up, reinforced by the greater-than-expected pass-"
through of higher costs linked to energy disruptions.
European Central Bank policy rates are expected to
rise more aggressively and be more persistent than
"previously anticipated, leading to growth in 2024"
being slower than previously assumed.
""
 The projection accounts for an earlier-than-expected
"change in China’s “zero-COVID” policy. As a result,"
growth in China in 2023 is now anticipated to be
stronger than previously projected.
Canadian outlook
""
 The labour market has been more resilient
"than expected, with robust job gains and the"
unemployment rate returning to near historical
lows. Job vacancies have also eased by less than
anticipated.
""
 The level of potential output has been revised up
by less than gross domestic product (GDP). The
economy is estimated to have been in greater
excess demand in the second half of 2022 than
previously projected. This is consistent with stronger
"labour demand. As a result, the projection begins"
with more excess demand and more domestic price
pressures.
""
 The levels of economic activity and of potential
output are both revised up over the projection.1
Table 2 and Table 3 present the revisions to the
forecast for GDP growth.
""
 The outlook for consumer price index infl
ation is
revised down by about ½ a percentage point in
"2023, mainly due to lower gasoline prices and a"
faster improvement in supply chain disruptions.
"At the same time, the outlook for core infl"
ation is
"revised up, refl"
ecting stronger demand.
1 The level of GDP at the end of 2024 is about 0.8% higher than previously
"expected, while the level of potential output is about 0.5% higher."

"In contrast, the key drivers of higher inflation in Europe have been more"
heavily influenced by increases in energy costs linked to Russia’s invasion
of Ukraine and the past depreciation of the euro. Tight labour markets are
also adding to labour costs. Services price inflation has risen and become
increasingly broad-based with the reopening of economies in the region.
Inflation is expected to decline over the projection horizon as the war’s effects
"on food and energy price inflation dissipate, past effects of supply chain"
"disruptions fade, and higher interest rates reduce demand growth."
Continued monetary policy tightening
With major central banks rapidly tightening monetary policy to address
"persistent inflationary pressures, financial conditions are restrictive. Nominal"
and real yields on long-term government bonds have risen substantially
"since the start of 2022. In particular, the yield on inflation-indexed 10-year"
US Treasury bonds has averaged 1.4% since the October Report—near its
highest level in the past decade.
"Nonetheless, financial conditions have eased somewhat since the October"
Report. This largely reflects a decline in risk premiums across asset classes
because headline inflation has edged down from its peak and the perceived
risk of an overtightening of monetary policy has decreased.
The Can$/US$ exchange rate has been reasonably stable at around 74 cents
"since the October Report (Chart 3 and Box 2). In contrast, the Canadian"
dollar has substantially depreciated against the currencies of other key trading
"partners, reversing the appreciation that took place through much of 2022."

BANK OF CANADA  •  Monetary Policy Report  •  January 2023
Weakening US activity
"The Bank projects US activity to remain generally flat through 2023, mostly"
because of the rise in interest rates. Growth is then expected to pick up
"gradually over the course of 2024, as the effects on growth of monetary"
policy tightening fade.
The outlook for Canadian exports largely depends on three components of
US demand:
""
 The recent strength in consumption spending is anticipated to slow in
early 2023. The boost to growth coming from high demand for in-person
services and a catch-up in motor vehicle sales should diminish over time.
Consumption spending is expected to pick up again in 2024 as the impact
of higher interest rates on growth dissipates.
""
 US residential investment has fallen sharply in response to the rise in
mortgage interest rates. This weakness is projected to continue through
the first half of 2023. New household formation and growth in disposable
income are expected to contribute to a rebound in residential investment
growth in the second half of the year.
""
 Business investment is projected to contract over 2023 and 2024 due to
weak demand and the high cost of capital.
Box 2
Key inputs to the projection
The Bank of Canada’s projection is conditional on
several key assumptions. Any changes to these will
affect the outlook for the Canadian economy. The Bank
regularly reviews these assumptions and how they may
impact the economic projection. The key inputs into the
Bank’s projection are as follows:
""
" Oil prices have fallen. Over the projection horizon,"
the per-barrel prices in US dollars are assumed
to be $85 for Brent and $80 for West Texas
"Intermediate, both $10 lower than assumed in the"
October Report. The per-barrel price of Western
"Canadian Select is assumed to be $60, which is"
$15 lower.
""
" By convention, the Bank does not forecast the"
exchange rate in the Monetary Policy Report. The
Canadian dollar is assumed to remain at 74 cents
"US over the projection horizon, close to its recent"
average and in line with the assumption in the
October Report.
""
 Potential output growth in Canada is expected to
increase from about 1% in 2022 to roughly 2¼% on
average over 2023 and 2024.
""
 Real gross domestic product is estimated to have
grown at a slower pace than potential output in
"the fourth quarter of 2022. As a result, the Bank"
estimates that the output gap is between 0.50% and
"1.50% in the fourth quarter, down from an upwardly"
revised estimate of 0.75% to 1.75% in the third quarter.
""
 The projection incorporates information from all
provincial and federal budgets available at the
"time of writing. Relative to the October Report, this"
includes about $6.5 billion in additional special
federal and provincial transfers for the fourth quarter
of 2022 and the fi
rst quarter of 2023 related to
infl
ation and affordability.
""
 The nominal neutral policy interest rate is defi
ned as
the real neutral rate plus 2% for infl
ation. The real
neutral rate is defi
ned as the rate consistent with
both output remaining sustainably at its potential and
infl
"ation remaining at target, on an ongoing basis. It"
is a medium- to long-term equilibrium concept. For
"Canada, the projection assumes that the nominal"
neutral rate is at the midpoint of the estimated range
of 2% to 3%. This range was last reassessed in the
April 2022 Report.

Slow activity in the euro area
The impact of the Russian invasion of Ukraine has weighed heavily on
economic activity in the euro area. Elevated natural gas prices have
"constrained industrial production, and high inflation has eroded purchasing"
power. Recent increases in interest rates are also starting to weigh on
demand. Business and consumer confidence has weakened considerably.
Warmer-than-normal weather this winter has helped bring down natural gas
"prices, and economic activity has been stronger than expected. The impacts"
"of the war and higher interest rates will continue to impede growth in 2023,"
but it is expected to pick up in 2024 as global demand recovers.
Near-term volatility in China
"China abruptly lifted many of its COVID-19 restrictions late in 2022, leading"
to considerable uncertainty about its economic outlook. The virus has spread
"rapidly, weighing on economic activity. Yet, with the reopened economy,"
growth is projected to rebound strongly as case numbers subside from their
currently high level.
The property sector will continue to slow activity. Past regulatory tightening—
aimed at reducing speculation and excess leverage among developers—
continues to cause the sector to contract sharply. While some recently
"announced policy measures should help stabilize activity, the outlook for the"
property market remains uncertain.
"Overall, growth in China is expected to strengthen in 2023 as in-person"
"activity rebounds, then to moderate in 2024 as activity normalizes."
Lower energy prices
"Oil prices have fallen since the October Report (Chart 4), partly because of"
an improved outlook for global oil supply. Markets now seem to expect that
Western sanctions will have less of an effect on Russian oil production. In the
"Bank’s projection, the price for Brent oil is assumed to be US$85 per barrel,"
while the price for West Texas Intermediate (WTI) is assumed to be US$5
below the Brent price.
"Since the October Report, the price for Western Canadian Select (WCS)"
"has traded, on average, close to US$30 per barrel lower than the price for"
WTI. Refinery outages and heavily discounted barrels of Russian heavy oil
on the global market have led to a wider-than-normal spread. The spread is
anticipated to narrow as refineries come back online in early 2023 and with
the completion of the new Trans Mountain pipeline expansion in 2024. Given
"this dynamic, the Bank assumes a constant spread between WCS and WTI"
of US$20 over the projection.
"Natural gas prices have fallen sharply, with benchmark prices for both the"
United States and Europe below their levels at the time of the October
Report. Price movements have tended to track weather conditions in the
northern hemisphere. European prices continue to trade well above US
"prices, given concerns about shortages caused by Russia’s decision to"
restrict gas exports to the continent.

The Bank’s non-energy commodity price index is roughly unchanged and is
expected to remain near current levels over the projection. Base metal prices
"rose after China announced additional support for its property sector, while"
lumber prices have fallen as North American housing demand continues to
weaken. Agricultural prices are largely the same as in October.

Canadian economy
CPI inflation in Canada is still too high but has declined from its recent peak.
Ongoing excess demand in the economy continues to exert upward pressure
"on prices. But, with lower energy prices, improvements in global supply"
"chains and the effects of higher interest rates moving through the economy,"
inflation has started to ease.
CPI inflation is forecast to fall to 3% in mid-2023 and return to the 2% target
in 2024. Inflation in 2023 is anticipated to be lower than projected in the
October Report. This is mainly due to gasoline prices dropping more
than expected and global supply chains improving more quickly than
anticipated (Box 1).
Economic growth is projected to slow at the end of 2022 and to stall through
the middle of 2023. The tightening of monetary policy initially slowed housing
activity followed by consumer demand for durables in the middle of 2022.
The effects of the rise in interest rates are expected to broaden and moderate
consumer spending on services as well as investment spending in 2023.
Growth is then projected to pick up in late 2023 (Table 2).

BANK OF CANADA  •  Monetary Policy Report  •  January 2023
High and broad-based inflation
"At 6.3% in December, CPI inflation remains high and broad-based, with core"
"inflation at about 5%.2 CPI inflation has, however, declined in recent months"
"(Chart 5), and the large price increases that were prominent during the rise in"
inflation are now a little less widespread (Chart 6).
""
" Most of the decline is due to lower gasoline prices, which fell from about"
$2 per litre in June 2022 to about $1.50 per litre in January 2023.
""
 Inflation for prices of goods excluding energy and food in stores has
declined. This is because of reduced demand for goods in Canada and
"abroad, combined with improving global supply conditions and falling costs"
for international shipping (Box 3).
""
" However, inflation for prices of services excluding shelter is more"
persistent.
""
" For food and shelter services, inflation remains particularly high. This is"
"because ongoing cost pressures are boosting food prices, while falling"
house prices are being offset by rising mortgage interest costs.
"Three-month CPI inflation has fallen to about 3½%, suggesting a significant"
slowdown in inflation in coming months (Chart 5 and Chart 7). But a further
drop will be required for inflation to reach the 2% target.
"2	 With the release of the January 2023 CPI, Statistics Canada will implement its routine revision policy."
"As a result, CPI-trim and CPI-median will be revised back 84 months. As of now, partial revisions"
"would leave CPI-trim inflation relatively unchanged, but CPI-median inflation would be up by around"
0.35 percentage points over recent months. The broad trends in both core inflation measures will remain
"intact. The All-items CPI, which is what the Bank targets, is not affected by these revisions. In addition,"
Statistics Canada will start publishing index-level data series for both core inflation measures. For further
"details, see the recent announcement by Statistics Canada."

Box 3
Explaining the dynamics of goods and services prices
A broad-based easing in price growth must occur to
sustainably return infl
ation to the 2% target. Recent
developments in food and shelter infl
ation were
discussed in Box 3 of the October Report. This current
Report focuses on goods excluding energy and food in
"stores and on services excluding shelter. Together, these"
components make up just over half of the CPI basket.
Distinguishing between prices for goods—which have
an international dimension—and prices for services—
which are more closely linked to domestic conditions—
is important.
Further slowing of infl
ation in goods excluding
food and energy
Items in the goods excluding energy and food in stores
"component account for 30% of the CPI basket, and they"
include many internationally traded goods. Prices for
goods tend to be among the most fl
exible and are highly
sensitive to changes in economic conditions.
Infl
"ation in this component has been high since mid-2021,"
refl
ecting strong global and domestic demand combined
with disrupted supply chains. Domestic conditions matter
because the strength of domestic demand infl
uences
how much fi
rms can mark up their prices above their
"costs. Several factors have pushed production costs up,"
"including supply chain disruptions, high energy prices"
and elevated shipping costs. But these forces have
become less intense in recent months.
""
 Growth in demand for goods has slowed in Canada
and abroad. This softening has been most notable
"for durable goods, such as appliances and furniture."
Demand for these goods is more sensitive to interest
rates.
""
 Supply chain disruptions are easing. Support for
"this view comes from business reports, data on"
trade fl
"ows and inventories, and indicators of supply"
"bottlenecks, such as the Global Supply Chain"
Pressure Index.
""
 Shipping costs and oil prices have declined
signifi
"cantly from their 2022 peaks. In fact, shipping"
costs have almost returned to their pre-pandemic
levels.
""
" Consequently, monthly increases in the prices of"
goods have slowed notably in the last few months.
This trend is expected to continue as supply conditions
improve and demand for durable goods moderates
"further (Chart 3-A, red line). As a result, infl"
ation in
this component will likely continue to decline.
Steady infl
ation in services prices in the near
term
The services excluding shelter component accounts for
24% of the CPI basket. This component includes a broad
"range of activities, such as personal care, transportation,"
"food in restaurants, recreation, car repairs and education."

Box 3 (continued)
Some prices for services do not adjust quickly. These
prices more closely refl
"ect domestic conditions, including"
"overall demand pressures, labour costs and expectations"
about future infl
ation. Labour market conditions and
productivity growth are also important because labour
costs make up a relatively large part of the total cost of
delivering services.
"As the economy fully reopened in spring 2022,"
demand rose sharply for hard-to-distance services.
"Consequently, in summer 2022, monthly price increases"
"were large for air transportation, travel services and"
food in restaurants. More modest price gains followed
in the last few months of 2022 as the boost in demand
"diminished. However, the large price gains earlier in"
2022 will likely keep infl
ation in prices for services
excluding shelter high through the fi
rst half of 2023
"(Chart 3-A, blue line)."
Unit labour cost has been growing well above what
would be consistent with reaching the 2% infl
ation
target.1 But growth in unit labour cost is expected to
slow. Higher interest rates are projected to slow demand
"for services, and wage growth is expected to ease. At"
"the same time, growth in labour productivity is assumed"
to gradually improve.
1 Unit labour cost is the ratio of labour compensation per worker to labour
productivity.
"A risk remains, however, that infl"
ation for services prices
will not adjust as quickly as anticipated. Labour cost
growth may be higher and more persistent than projected.
This could happen if productivity growth rebounds more
"slowly than expected; for instance, if business investment"
is weaker than anticipated. The labour market could also
remain tight for longer than projected.

Elevated inflation expectations
"Most respondents to consumer and business surveys still expect that, over"
"the next two years, CPI inflation will be well above 2% and higher than the"
"Bank’s inflation forecast (Chart 8). For the fourth quarter of 2022, many"
respondents to both the Business Outlook Survey (BOS) and the Canadian
Survey of Consumer Expectations (CSCE) identified supply-side issues as
the main factors behind high inflation. These include the effects of supply
"chain disruptions, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, high energy prices and labour"
shortages.
Short-term inflation expectations in the BOS have declined from their peak in
"the second quarter of 2022. At the same time, the share of firms expecting"
"significant price increases has continued to decrease (Chart 9). However,"
the distribution of inflation expectations remains markedly wider than it was
"before the pandemic, suggesting that the level of uncertainty about inflation"
over the next few years remains high.
"Long-term expectations for CPI inflation, in contrast, remain consistent with"
the 2% target. This signals respondents’ ongoing confidence that the Bank
will return inflation to 2%.

BANK OF CANADA  •  Monetary Policy Report  •  January 2023
Economy in excess demand
"The pace of economic growth in Canada is slowing, but demand continues to"
exceed supply.
"The labour market is still tight across a broad range of measures, suggesting"
that it remains above maximum sustainable employment (Chart 10).
Employment gains were robust in the fourth quarter of 2022. More than
"220,000 net jobs were created, and the unemployment rate, at 5%, is near"
an all-time low. The number of job vacancies also remains high despite
"recent declines (Chart 11). Firms continue to have difficulties finding workers,"
"which reflects strong labour demand, the impacts of an aging population and"
shortages of available workers with the desired skills (Box 4).
Wage growth remains broad-based and appears to have plateaued in the 4%
"to 5% range (Chart 12). With the pace of wage growth no longer increasing,"
"the risk of a wage-price spiral has declined. However, unless a surprisingly"
"strong pickup in productivity growth occurs, sustained 4% to 5% wage growth"
is not consistent with achieving the 2% inflation target.
Monetary policy appears to be slowing the demand for labour. Employment
growth has been weaker in sectors that are sensitive to changes in the
"interest rate, including manufacturing, construction and trade. Overall,"
employment growth in the second half of 2022 moderated compared with that
in the first half of the year. The full effects of high interest rates on the labour
market are expected to play out over an extended period.

Box 4
Labour supply challenges
Canadian fi
rms continue to face challenges hiring
workers with the desired skills and experience. Amid
"strong growth in labour demand, the slow rise in the"
number of workers has contributed to a tight labour
market.
The annual growth of the labour force moderated
from an average of about 1.4% over 2017–19 to about
0.9% over 2020–22. The labour force would have an
"additional 320,000 workers if it had maintained its"
1.4% growth pace between 2020 and 2022.
This easing of growth in the labour force is because
of population aging and the interruption of immigration
fl
ows in 2020. The recent increase in immigration and
the rise in the participation rate of prime-age women
have mitigated this decline.1
Growth in labour supply has not kept pace with growth
"in labour demand since the end of 2019, when the"
Canadian labour market was already judged to be tight.
"As a result, the number of job vacancies has risen, and"
businesses continue to face labour shortages.
Aging workforce
Population aging has pushed down the overall
participation rate by about 0.9 percentage points since
February 2020. This has weighed on growth of labour
supply and exacerbated labour market challenges.
The increase in the share of older workers plays an
important role in the slow growth seen in the labour
force in recent years. Workers aged 55 and over have
"been the fastest-growing age group, and they have the"
lowest participation rate. The participation rate for these
older workers has declined from 38.1% in February 2020
"to 36.2% in December 2022 (Chart 4-A), largely due to"
aging within the group.
Skills mismatch
Another labour supply challenge that businesses face is
hiring and retaining workers with the right set of skills and
experience. Available workers may have different skills
than what employers are looking for. Firms responding to
the Business Outlook Survey often cited shortages in a
broad range of occupations across industries.
Participation rate of women
The recent rise in the participation rate of prime-age
"Canadians, especially women, has somewhat offset"
1 Prime-age workers are individuals aged 25 to 54.
the effect of aging on the overall participation rate. The
participation rate for prime-age women stands near
record highs. It increased from 83.6% in February 2020
"to 84.9% in December 2022, and this increase has been"
notable for women with young children (Chart 4-B).
This rise in the participation rate of women could be due
"to lower average fees for child care since April 2022,"
as measured by the consumer price index. The
decrease in the cost of child care stems from the early
learning and child care agreements signed between
the federal and provincial governments. More fl
exible
"work arrangements, including remote work, may have"
also encouraged many women to join the workforce.
This increase in the participation rate of prime-age
women has expanded the labour force by almost
"100,000 people, helping ease fi"
rms’ labour shortages
and hiring challenges.
Rising immigration
Newcomers to Canada have been an important source
of labour supply growth. In the fi
ve years before the
"pandemic, progressively higher immigration boosted"
population growth. But the pandemic disrupted the
fl
"ow of immigrants, contributing to a decrease in labour"
supply in 2020.

Box 4 (continued)
Immigration levels have since bounced back because
"borders have reopened. About 480,000 newcomers joined"
the Canadian labour force between December 2020
and December 2022. This rebound in labour supply
"has mostly made up for the pandemic shortfall, partly"
refl
ecting higher infl
ows of economic-class permanent
residents and temporary foreign workers.2
Immigration increases Canada’s labour supply and
rate of potential output growth.3 It can alleviate labour
shortages in constrained sectors. Despite these
benefi
"ts, increased immigration alone cannot eliminate"
an economy-wide imbalance between labour supply and
demand. This is because the increase in immigration
pushes up labour supply and increases the number of
consumers.
Short supply of labour
The Canadian labour force has increased by about
"560,000 people since the end of 2019, representing"
an increase of about 2.8%. Continued growth in the
working-age population fuelled this expansion in the
"number of workers over the last three years, despite"
the decline in the overall participation rate due to
population aging.
"However, this increase in labour supply did not match"
the strong growth in labour demand over the past
"two years. As a result, labour markets remain tight."

Improvements can already be seen on the supply side. In the most recent
"BOS, the number of Canadian firms reporting obstacles due to supply chain"
bottlenecks was cut in half (Chart 13). With fewer supply chain bottlenecks
"constraining activity, goods imports and inventory investment remained high"
in the third quarter of 2022.
"Despite this improvement, many Canadian firms continue to face supply-side"
difficulties. Businesses continue to report challenges sourcing a wide range
"of inputs, including building materials, restaurant supplies and food products."
Labour shortages are also restricting firms’ ability to meet demand from their
customers.
The estimate of the output gap—the difference between GDP and potential
output—is between 0.5% and 1.5% in the fourth quarter of 2022. This is more
excess demand than was projected in the October Report.
Stalling demand growth and rising supply
"Growth is estimated to have slowed in the fourth quarter of 2022, with activity"
expected to stall through the middle of 2023 (Table 3 and Chart 14). In this
"context, the likelihood of a couple of quarters with slightly negative growth is"
roughly the same as that of a couple of quarters with slightly positive growth.
The rise in interest rates started to slow demand for housing and big-
"ticket items in 2022, although motor vehicle sales likely ended the year"
strong because deliveries started to catch up with orders. The tightening of
monetary policy in Canada and abroad is expected to have broader effects in
2023. Spending on consumer services and business investment is expected
"to slow, while weaker foreign demand weighs on exports."

"Slower demand growth, combined with improvements in the supply chain,"
lead the economy into modest excess supply in 2023.
"Growth is projected to pick up later in 2023, reaching 2½% in the second"
half of 2024 as the effects of interest rate increases fade. Strong population
growth due to immigration provides important underlying support to
real economic growth. Potential output growth settles just above 2% in
2023 and 2024.

Slow growth in household spending
Consumer spending is projected to remain subdued through much of 2023.
Responses to the CSCE indicate that consumers are cutting spending and
delaying purchases across a broad range of goods and services because of
high interest rates and elevated inflation (Chart 15).
The rise in borrowing costs is expected to continue to strain many household
budgets. Interest payments on household mortgages are estimated to be
"about 4.5% of disposable income at the beginning of 2023, up from 3.2%"
at the beginning of 2022.3 The share of income going to mortgage interest
payments is anticipated to continue rising as more homeowners renew their
mortgages at higher rates.
Elevated interest rates are also increasing the costs of financing big-
ticket items such as furniture and appliances. Spending on these items
has decreased and is expected to remain subdued throughout 2023. As
the effects of higher interest rates continue to work their way through the
"economy, spending on services will also be affected. Experience suggests"
"that the demand for communications services, travel, hotels and meals at"
restaurants will be the most affected services components.4 Low consumer
confidence and reduced household wealth due to falling house prices will
also restrain household spending (Chart 16).
3	 Interest payments are one component of mortgage payments. Payments against mortgage principal are
another.
"4	 Communications services include internet access, wireless telecommunications and landlines."

Consumption growth is expected to increase at the end of 2023 and
continue to strengthen through 2024. This is because the restraining effects
on spending associated with higher interest rates should stabilize. Strong
population growth supports consumer spending over the projection horizon.
The savings rate is expected to remain above its long-run average due to
elevated interest rates and precautionary savings.
The pullback in housing activity that began in 2022 is expected to continue
"over the near term (Chart 17). House prices are projected to decline further,"
particularly in markets that saw significant increases during the pandemic.
Growth in new construction and housing resales will likely pick up by the second
"half of 2023, supported by low inventories and strong demand from immigration."

Moderate export growth
Soft foreign demand weighs on export growth over the near term. Growth
strengthens in 2024 as the global recovery takes hold (Chart 18).
Growth of non-commodity exports is modest in 2023 before increasing in
2024. The easing of supply chain disruptions and the ongoing recovery in
international travel are anticipated to support growth this year.
Non-energy commodity exports are expected to continue to grow at a solid
"pace in 2023, boosted by shipments of the abundant 2022 harvest. In 2024,"
growth in this sector should remain robust as global growth strengthens.
"Growth in energy exports is anticipated to be moderate in 2023, and then"
pick up strongly in 2024 with the completion of the Trans Mountain Expansion
project.
"Imports are projected to decline in the near term, largely due to the slowdown"
in inventory investment from currently elevated levels. Imports increase later
in the projection horizon because of strengthening domestic demand and the
growing number of Canadians travelling abroad.
Soft business investment
Growth in business investment is expected to be slow over the projection
"horizon, strengthening only toward the end of 2024 (Chart 19). Ongoing"
digital transformation is expected to continue to support business investment
throughout the period.
"Slowing demand, elevated borrowing costs and increased uncertainty about"
future economic conditions weaken investment outside the oil and gas sector
in 2023. BOS respondents frequently cited high borrowing costs as a key
factor weighing on investment intentions. Investment picks up modestly in
2024 as demand strengthens.

BANK OF CANADA  •  Monetary Policy Report  •  January 2023
"After solid gains in 2021 and 2022, growth in investment in the oil and gas"
sector is projected to moderate. This is partly due to uncertainty about long-
term demand around the transition to a low-carbon economy.
Although firms are expected to continue to rebuild their stocks as supply
"chain bottlenecks ease further, they are projected to accumulate inventory"
more slowly.
"Declining inflation in 2023, return to target in 2024"
CPI inflation is forecast to decline from 6.7% in the fourth quarter of 2022 to
3% in the middle of 2023 and to reach the 2% target in 2024 (Chart 5 and
"Chart 20). In 2023, it is anticipated to be somewhat lower than projected in"
the October Report due to weaker gasoline prices and a quicker improvement
in supply chain disruptions (Box 1).
A large share of firms that responded to the BOS continue to expect that
pressures on their input costs and output prices will be less intense going
"forward than they were over the past 12 months. Moreover, many businesses"
report that they are gradually returning to price-setting practices they used
before the pandemic. These include reducing the size and frequency of price
"changes, tracking competitors’ pricing more closely and waiting for cost"
increases to materialize before considering altering prices.5 This could result
in some narrowing of pricing margins.
Inflation is projected to reach 3.5% in the second quarter of 2023. The
slowdown reflects the sharp decline in quarter-over-quarter price growth that
occurred in the second half of 2022 (Chart 21). The decline results from a
sharp fall in energy prices and weaker inflation in goods excluding food and
energy (Box 3). The weaker inflation in goods comes about from slower
"global demand for goods, an improvement in supply chains, a decline in the"
costs of some materials and a return to more normal pricing behaviour.

BANK OF CANADA  •  Monetary Policy Report  •  January 2023
"In contrast, inflation in the prices of services excluding shelter is projected"
to remain elevated through the first half of 2023. This is consistent with
robust demand and continued strong growth in unit labour costs. Inflation
for prices of shelter and food in stores ease but remain elevated and above
CPI inflation.
Inflation is projected to continue to decline toward the target through 2024.
This reflects more normal global supply conditions and the effects of higher
"interest rates on demand for services (Chart 20). However, considerable"
"uncertainty surrounds the outlook. In particular, it could take longer than"
expected for the rise in interest rates to weaken both demand and labour
costs enough to push services price inflation down significantly (see Risks to
the inflation outlook).

Risks to the inflation outlook
Risks to the inflation outlook
The risks identified in the October Report remain important for the inflation
"outlook. Although the Bank views these risks as roughly balanced, the upside"
risks are of greater concern because inflation is still too high.
Main upside risk: Stickier services price inflation
The main upside risk is that services price inflation in Canada could be
stickier than projected if elevated inflation expectations or increased labour
costs prove more persistent than expected. There is also risk of a resurgence
in global energy prices related to a faster rebound in the Chinese economy
and ongoing uncertainty about Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. These risks
were identified in the October Report and remain a concern.
Although short-term inflation expectations in Canada have declined and
"fewer firms expect large price increases, short-term inflation expectations"
remain above the Bank’s inflation forecast. Survey responses indicate that
"the distribution of expectations is wider than normal. As a result, the risk"
remains that inflation expectations and therefore inflation could be higher
than expected. This risk is most pronounced for inflation in services (Box 3).
Services price inflation could also remain elevated if labour costs rise more
than projected. Growth in labour costs is about 5% on a year-over-year basis.
"In the projection, growth in overall labour costs moderates to fall in line with"
the 2% inflation target. Services price inflation could be more persistent than
projected if productivity growth rebounds more slowly than expected or if the
labour market remains tighter for longer than anticipated.
Global factors such as improved supply chains and lower energy prices have
eased pressure on inflation more than anticipated at the time of the October
Report. But China’s lifting of COVID-19 restrictions could lead to stronger-
"than-projected global growth and higher commodity prices, especially for oil."
The ability of the world’s energy supply to respond to shocks is weaker than
"in the past, exacerbating this risk. An intensification of the supply disruptions"
related to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine could also trigger spikes in the prices
"of oil, natural gas and agricultural products. More broadly, an increase in"
"geopolitical tensions could prolong disruptions to supply chains, risking"
higher prices on internationally traded goods.
An additional upside risk to the inflation outlook identified in October was
that households could draw on their accumulated wealth and savings more
than expected. This would lead to increased household spending and greater
"upward pressure on inflation. Since then, however, consumption spending"
"has been weaker than expected, so this risk to the inflation outlook is"
somewhat reduced.

Main downside risk: Severe global slowdown
"Similar to that noted in the October Report, a severe global slowdown is the"
"key downside risk to inflation. As monetary policy tightens in key economies,"
"long-standing global financial vulnerabilities, such as high levels of debt,"
could amplify the impacts of slowing global growth.
"The Canadian economy could be affected through weaker foreign demand,"
lower terms of trade and spillovers into Canada’s financial system. The
resulting tighter financial conditions and higher unemployment could
undermine homebuyer sentiment and lead to a larger-than-expected drop in
"house prices. This in turn could reduce household wealth, access to credit"
and consumer confidence.
The risk of a severe global downturn remains but appears to have lessened
"since the October Report. The outlook for growth has improved, financial"
"conditions have eased, and the US dollar has weakened. The weaker"
US dollar has reduced pressure on some emerging-market economies.
The October Report also outlined the risk that the spike in some goods
prices since the beginning of the pandemic could be reversed. While energy
and transportation costs have fallen and inflation in some goods prices has
"eased, widespread price reversals have not yet occurred."
