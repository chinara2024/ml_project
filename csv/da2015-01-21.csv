Bank of Canada lowers overnight rate target
to 3/4 per cent
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Media Relations
"Ottawa, Ontario"
"January 21, 2015"
The Bank of Canada today announced that it is lowering its target for the
overnight rate by one-quarter of one percentage point to 3/4 per cent. The Bank
Rate is correspondingly 1 per cent and the deposit rate is 1/2 per cent. This
"decision is in response to the recent sharp drop in oil prices, which will be"
negative for growth and underlying inflation in Canada.
Inflation has remained close to the 2 per cent target in recent quarters. Core
inflation has been temporarily boosted by sector-specific factors and the pass-
"through effects of the lower Canadian dollar, which are offsetting disinflationary"
pressures from slack in the economy and competition in the retail sector. Total
CPI inflation is starting to reflect the fall in oil prices.
Oil’s sharp decline in the past six months is expected to boost global economic
"growth, especially in the United States, while widening the divergences among"
economies. Persistent headwinds from deleveraging and lingering uncertainty will
influence the extent to which some oil-importing countries benefit from lower
prices. The Bank’s base-case projection assumes oil prices around US$60 per
barrel. Prices are currently lower but our belief is that prices over the medium
term are likely to be higher.
The oil price shock is occurring against a backdrop of solid and more broadly-
"based growth in Canada in recent quarters. Outside the energy sector, we are"
"beginning to see the anticipated sequence of increased foreign demand, stronger"
"exports, improved business confidence and investment, and employment growth."
"However, there is considerable uncertainty about the speed with which this"
sequence will evolve and how it will be affected by the drop in oil prices. Business
investment in the energy-producing sector will decline. Canada’s weaker terms of
"trade will have an adverse impact on incomes and wealth, reducing domestic"
demand growth.

"Although there is considerable uncertainty around the outlook, the Bank is"
projecting real GDP growth will slow to about 1 1/2 per cent and the output gap to
widen in the first half of 2015. The negative impact of lower oil prices will
"gradually be mitigated by a stronger U.S. economy, a weaker Canadian dollar, and"
the Bank’s monetary policy response. The Bank expects Canada’s economy to
"gradually strengthen in the second half of this year, with real GDP growth"
averaging 2.1 per cent in 2015 and 2.4 per cent in 2016. The economy is expected
"to return to full capacity around the end of 2016, a little later than was expected in"
October.
Weaker oil prices will pull down the inflation profile. Total CPI inflation is projected
"to be temporarily below the inflation-control range during 2015, moving back up"
to target the following year. Underlying inflation will ease in the near term but
then return gradually to 2 per cent over the projection horizon.
The oil price shock increases both downside risks to the inflation profile and
financial stability risks. The Bank’s policy action is intended to provide insurance
"against these risks, support the sectoral adjustment needed to strengthen"
"investment and growth, and bring the Canadian economy back to full capacity and"
inflation to target within the projection horizon.
Information note:
The next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is 4 March
"2015. The next full update of the Bank’s outlook for the economy and inflation,"
"including risks to the projection, will be published in the Monetary Policy Report on"
15 April 2015.
