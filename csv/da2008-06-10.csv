Bank of Canada keeps overnight rate target
at 3 per cent
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Media Relations
"Ottawa, Ontario"
"June 10, 2008"
The Bank of Canada today announced that it is maintaining its target for the
overnight rate at 3 per cent. The operating band for the overnight rate is
"unchanged, and the Bank Rate remains at 3 1/4 per cent."
"Since the April Monetary Policy Report (MPR), economic developments have been"
"broadly in line with expectations. However, the balance of risks to the Bank's April"
projection for inflation in Canada has shifted slightly to the upside. Although the
composition of U.S. growth has not been favourable for demand for Canadian
"goods and services, overall, global growth has been stronger and commodity"
"prices have been sharply higher than expected. At the same time, many of the"
"downside risks to inflation identified in the April MPR have eased, while the"
evolution of credit conditions has been in line with expectations. The risk remains
that potential growth will be weaker than assumed.
"With the decline in first-quarter GDP, the Canadian economy is judged to have"
"moved into excess supply, which is expected to increase this year. Consistent with"
"the April MPR, the Bank continues to project that economic growth will pick up this"
"year and accelerate in 2009, owing in part to a firming of U.S. demand and"
accommodative monetary policy in Canada.
"If current levels of energy prices persist, total CPI inflation will rise above 3 per"
"cent later this year. However, with the Canadian economy operating in excess"
"supply, core inflation is expected to remain below 2 per cent through 2009. Both"
total and core inflation should converge on 2 per cent in 2010 as the economy
returns to balance.
"Against this backdrop, the Bank now judges that the current stance of monetary"
policy is appropriately accommodative to bring aggregate demand and supply
into balance and to achieve the 2 per cent inflation target. There continue to be
"important downside and upside risks to inflation in Canada, which the Bank will"
monitor closely.
