MONETARY POLICY REPORT
UPDATE
– July 2005 –
This text is a commentary of the Governing Council of the Bank of Canada.
It presents the Bank’s updated outlook based on information
received up to 11 July 2005.
Introduction
The update on global and Canadian
economic developments presented in this
"Report highlights three issues. First, the bal-"
ance of information on capacity pressures
indicates that the Canadian economy is op-
erating close to its production limits. Sec-
"ond, over the past several months, further"
progress has been made across sectors of
the Canadian economy in adjusting to glo-
"bal developments. Third, while the risks to"
"the outlook through 2006 appear balanced,"
the medium-term risks related to global im-
balances are increasing.
"On the whole, the Bank’s outlook for"
output and inflation in Canada through to
the end of 2006 is little changed from the
scenario outlined in the April Monetary
Policy Report.
The global economy has been unfold-
"ing broadly as expected, and prospects re-"
main favourable for growth of about 4 per
"cent this year and next. However, growth"
has been less balanced than expected across
economic
"zones,"
with
the
momentum
stronger in Asia but weaker in Europe.
"In Canada, strong growth in final do-"
mestic demand continues to offset the drag
from net exports. The Bank’s base-case
projection calls for growth of real GDP to be
2.7 per cent in 2005 and to rise to 3.3 per
cent in 2006. The Canadian economy is thus
expected to remain near its production ca-
"pacity through the period, and inflation is"
projected to return to 2 per cent by the end
of next year.
Highlights
• The economy is operating close to its
production capacity.
• The Bank’s outlook is little changed from
"the April Monetary Policy Report, with"
growth projected to be 2.7 per cent in 2005
and 3.3 per cent in 2006.
• With the economy thus projected to
continue to operate near its production
"capacity, inflation is expected to return to"
2 per cent by the end of next year.
"• In line with this outlook, some reduction"
of monetary stimulus will be required in
the near term.
• Risks to the outlook through 2006 appear
"balanced, but over the medium term,"
risks related to global imbalances are
increasing.
MONETARY POLICY REPORT UPDATE: JULY 2005

"To support aggregate demand, the"
Bank has held the target for the overnight
rate unchanged at 2 1/2 per cent since
"October 2004 (Chart 1). However, in line"
"with the Bank’s outlook, some reduction in"
the amount of monetary stimulus will be
required in the near term to keep aggregate
demand and supply in balance and infla-
tion on target.
Risks to the outlook over the next four to
six quarters relate primarily to the future
path of oil and non-energy commodity
"prices, the pace of growth in China, and the"
ongoing adjustment of the Canadian econ-
omy to global developments. These risks
appear balanced.
"Over the medium term, there is increas-"
ing risk that the correction of global current
account imbalances could involve a period
of weakness in world aggregate demand.
Medium-term risks will be more fully
addressed in the October Monetary Policy
"Report, when the Bank’s projection horizon"
is extended to include 2007.
Overview of Recent Economic
and Financial Developments
Canada’s real GDP rose at an annual
"rate of 2.3 per cent in the first quarter of 2005,"
very close to the 2.5 per cent rate expected
"at the time of the April Report. However, at"
"5.8 per cent, the expansion of final domestic"

demand was stronger than anticipated in
"the April Report, while reductions in both"
net
exports
and
inventory
investment
weighed more negatively on growth than
expected (Chart 2).
There is further evidence that the Cana-
dian economy is continuing to adjust to
global developments. The strong gains in
final domestic demand generated further
solid output growth in sectors with a low
exposure to foreign competition. In con-
"trast, since the end of 2004, there has"
been a small reduction in the overall level
of activity in non-commodity-producing
industries highly exposed to international
competition.
While production also declined in
commodity-producing industries during the
"first quarter, this largely reflected tem-"
porary production disruptions at an oil
"sands facility, the impact of adverse weath-"
"er conditions on oil and gas drilling, and"
reduced foreign demand for lumber. These
industries staged a partial recovery in April.
The results from the Bank’s summer
Business Outlook Survey also show that the
Canadian economy is adjusting to global
"developments. For example, capital spend-"
ing is expected to increase particularly
strongly in commodity-producing industries
and in many areas of the services sector.
The Survey also suggests that employment

growth will continue to be concentrated
in service and commodity-producing
industries.
"Based on available information, it ap-"
pears that the Canadian economy grew by
about 2.3 per cent in the second quarter.
Current indicators suggest that final do-
mestic demand continued to rise solidly.
"Moreover, several developments point to"
the prospect of a pickup in the pace of ac-
tivity in the second half of the year. A fur-
ther decrease in the rate of inventory
accumulation in the second quarter should
leave inventory levels and sales better
aligned. Momentum appears to be building
in
capital
"spending,"
and
employment
growth has picked up.
The Bank’s conventional estimate of
the output gap indicates that the economy
was operating with a slight amount of excess
supply
in
the
second
quarter
of
2005
(Chart 3). Based on its assessment of all
"indicators, it is the Governing Council’s"

Pressures on Capacity
The Bank’s conventional measure of potential output was revised down slightly from
"the estimate used in the April Report, reflecting the downward revision to Statistics Cana-"
da’s estimates of real GDP over the period from 2002 to mid-2004. With GDP growth in the
"last three quarters of 2004 revised upwards, however, the level of real GDP at the end of 2004"
"was left unchanged. Consequently, the Bank’s conventional measure of the output gap"
suggests that the economy was operating at its capacity limits in the first quarter of
"2005, instead of very slightly below its production capacity as projected in the last Report."
"With economic growth likely to have been 2.3 per cent in the second quarter, a slight"
amount of economic slack is expected to have emerged by mid-2005.
"Statistics Canada’s measure of capacity utilization in the non-farm, goods-producing"
sector1 suggests greater pressure on production capacity than the Bank’s conventional
estimate of the output gap.
"Other indicators, however, point to less pressure. For instance, wage increases have"
"remained quite moderate, and core inflation, on average, has been below 2 per cent since"
mid-2003.
"Similarly, the proportion of companies reporting labour shortages in the summer Busi-"
"ness Outlook Survey remained lower than average, while the percentage of firms reporting dif-"
ficulties meeting an unanticipated increase in demand was slightly higher than average.
Capacity constraints are felt most strongly in the construction and commodity-produc-
"ing sectors, as well as in transportation services."
Evaluating the level and growth of potential output is complicated by the sectoral shifts
associated with the adjustment of the Canadian economy to higher commodity prices and
the appreciation of the Canadian dollar.
"1. While that measure has been revised upwards, the revision chieﬂy reﬂected a change in Statistics Can-"
ada’s methodology for estimating potential output in the oil and gas extraction industry.

judgment that the economy was operating
with slightly more excess supply at mid-
year than the conventional measure
"suggests, but was still close to its capacity"
limits. (See box on page 3.)
The 12-month rate of increase in the
consumer price index has continued to
"exhibit considerable volatility, rising to"
2.4 per cent in April and falling to 1.6 per
cent in May (Chart 4). This is largely due to
fluctuations in gasoline prices.
"In contrast, the core rate of inflation has"
"remained relatively stable, fluctuating in a"
range between 1.6 and 1.9 per cent since the
beginning of the year.
"Since late May, world oil prices have"
strengthened further. Current oil futures
contracts indicate that the West Texas Inter-
mediate (WTI) price of oil will average
around US$60 per barrel over the projec-
tion period. This scenario for oil prices is
somewhat higher than that used in the last
"Report, especially for 2006."
The External Environment
"On balance, the global economy has"
been unfolding largely as expected at the
"time of the April Report, with prospects for"
growth essentially unchanged at about
4 per cent in both 2005 and 2006.
U.S. real GDP grew by 3.8 per cent at an-
"nual rates in the first quarter of 2005, in line"

with expectations. Monthly indicators for
the second quarter point to solid growth in
"domestic demand. As a result, the base-case"
outlook for U.S. economic growth in 2005 is
"essentially the same as in the April Report,"
which called for robust growth in 2005.
Output growth is projected to remain
strong in the United States in 2006. The
projection assumes a gradual slowing in
household spending and a rise in net exports.
Growth has been less balanced than an-
"ticipated across other economic zones, with"
momentum stronger than expected in Asia
"but weaker in Europe. In this regard,"
growth in China’s real GDP has remained
"very strong, and the first-quarter rebound"
in Japan’s real GDP was larger than expected.
"In contrast, in the euro area, evidence sug-"
gests slightly slower growth than that
incorporated in the April Report.
Financial Conditions
The Canadian dollar has traded in a
range of about 79 to 83 cents U.S. since the
"time of the April Report, as it has since the"
"beginning of the year. However, with the"
U.S. dollar appreciating against other ma-
"jor currencies, the Canadian dollar has risen"
modestly on a trade-weighted basis.
Yields on short-term government bonds
in Canada have remained relatively stable
"since the April Report, while comparable"
yields in the United States have moved
"somewhat higher, reflecting actual and an-"
ticipated increases in the federal funds rate.
Long-term government bond yields
in both countries have fallen by between
20 and 30 basis points. This decline has
"been part of a global phenomenon, with"
longer-term yields in most industrial coun-
tries at very low levels. While this may
"partly reflect several technical factors, the"
low yields would be consistent with strong
desired global savings relative to business
investment. Risk premiums on corporate
bonds are also very low.

Domestic Economic Prospects
"In Canada, solid growth in final domes-"
tic demand is expected to continue to con-
tribute importantly to economic activity
over
the
remainder
of
this
year
and
through 2006 (Table 1). Various factors sug-
gest further substantial gains in business
investment. These include the high rate of
capacity utilization in a number of indus-
"tries, the global economic expansion and"
the associated relatively high level of com-
"modity prices, continued favourable finan-"
"cial conditions, buoyant profit levels, and"
earlier reductions in the prices of imported
machinery and equipment.
Following a strong advance in the first
"quarter of 2005, consumer spending is"
expected to rise solidly over the projection
period. This reflects further gains in real in-
"comes, the continued effects of past mone-"
"tary stimulus, and a relatively high level of"
"consumer confidence. In contrast, invest-"
ment in housing is expected to be little
"changed, on balance, over this period. The"
current outlook incorporates somewhat
higher growth in government spending
"than in the April Report. Nevertheless, ex-"
penditures by all levels of government are
still projected to rise broadly in line with
"revenues,"
as
governments
continue
to
strive to maintain fiscal balance.
Ongoing
solid
global
economic
"growth, particularly in the United States, is"
expected to boost the demand for Canadian
"exports, while imports will be bolstered by"
strong investment in machinery and equip-
ment. The earlier appreciation of the Cana-
dian dollar is expected to continue to
dampen Canada’s export growth and to
"stimulate imports, but this effect should"
lessen considerably next year. The negative
contribution of net exports to real GDP
growth appears to have peaked and is ex-
pected to fall to zero in 2006 (Table 1).
The Bank’s base-case projection calls for
"economic growth, on an average annual"
"basis, to be 2.7 per cent in 2005 and to rise to"
3.3 per cent in 2006. This outlook for both 2005
and 2006 is essentially the same as in the April
Report.
The Bank projects that real GDP growth
"will increase to about 3 per cent, on average,"
in the second half of 2005 and 3.4 per cent
"over the four quarters of 2006 (Chart 5, Ta-"
ble 2). Based on an assumed rate of growth
"of potential output of 3 per cent, this out-"
look implies that the economy will be oper-
ating at capacity in the second half of 2006.
Labour productivity in the first quarter
of 2005 was up 1 per cent from its year-ear-
"lier level, following two years of surpris-"
ingly low growth. While the rebound is
"encouraging, productivity growth remains"
below the Bank’s assumption for trend
growth in productivity of 1 3/4 per cent.

The Bank will continue to assess productiv-
ity developments for indications of growth
in potential output.
The Outlook for Inﬂation
The factors governing the outlook for
inflation are the same as those described in
the April Report.
The core rate of inflation is expected
to remain close to 1.7 per cent over the re-
mainder of this year. With the economy
projected to operate near its full production
"capacity, and with inflation expectations"
"remaining well anchored, the core rate is"
projected to rise gradually to 2 per cent by
the end of next year (Table 2).
The outlook for the 12-month rate of in-
crease in the total CPI will continue to be im-
portantly affected by developments in the
market for crude oil. Based on an average
"of recent oil-price futures, total CPI inflation"
is expected to move up to about 2.5 per cent
"in late 2005. By the end of 2006, total CPI in-"
flation is expected to have moved back
down to the target rate of 2 per cent.
