CANADA’S INFLATION-CONTROL STRATEGY*
Inflation control and the economy
• Inflation control is not an end in itself; it is the means whereby monetary
policy contributes to solid economic performance.
• Low inflation allows the economy to function more effectively. This con-
tributes to better economic growth over time and works to moderate
cyclical fluctuations in output and employment.
The monetary policy instrument
• Announcements regarding the Bank’s policy instrument—the target over-
"night interest rate—take place, under normal circumstances, on eight pre-"
specified dates during the year.
"• In setting a target for the overnight rate, the Bank of Canada influences"
short-term interest rates to achieve a rate of monetary expansion consis-
tent with the inflation-control target. The transmission mechanism is com-
plex and involves long and variable lags—the impact on inflation from
changes in policy rates is usually spread over six to eight quarters.
The targets
"• In February 1991, the federal government and the Bank of Canada jointly"
agreed on a series of targets for reducing total CPI inflation to the mid-
point of a range of 1 to 3 per cent by the end of 1995. The inflation tar-
"get has been extended a number of times. In November 2006, the"
agreement was renewed for a period of five years to the end of
"2011. Under this agreement, the Bank will continue to conduct"
"monetary policy aimed at keeping total CPI inflation at 2 per cent,"
with a control range of 1 to 3 per cent around the target.
Monitoring inflation
"• In the short run, a good deal of movement in the CPI is caused by transi-"
tory fluctuations in the prices of such volatile components as fruit and
"gasoline, as well as by changes in indirect taxes. For this reason, the Bank"
uses a core measure of CPI inflation as an indicator of the underlying trend
in inflation. This core measure excludes eight of the most volatile compo-
nents of the CPI and adjusts the remaining components to remove the
effect of changes in indirect taxes.

MONETARY POLICY REPORT
— October 2007 —
This is a report of the Governing Council of the Bank of Canada:
"David Dodge, Paul Jenkins, Sheryl Kennedy, Pierre Duguay,"
"David Longworth, and Tiff Macklem."
Canada has enjoyed roughly 15 years of sustained economic
"growth, with low and stable inflation and increasingly"
healthy public finances … At least part of the credit for our
continued economic performance should go to our sound
"framework for macroeconomic policy, which includes the"
transparent monetary policy of inflation targeting … as well
as a sound fiscal policy.
David Dodge
"Governor, Bank of Canada"

1. OVERVIEW
There have been a number of significant economic and financial de-
velopments since the time of the July Monetary Policy Report Update.
Against a backdrop of robust global economic expansion and strong
"commodity prices, growth in the Canadian economy has been stronger"
than projected with considerable momentum in domestic demand. The
economy is now operating further above its production potential than
"had been previously expected. The core rate of inflation, which has"
"been above 2 per cent for the past year, was 2.2 per cent in August."
Total consumer price inflation fell temporarily in August to 1.7 per
"cent, having been above the 2 per cent inflation target since the spring."
"Since the July Update, the outlook for the U.S. economy has weak-"
ened because of greater-than-expected slowing in the housing sector.
The Bank has revised down its projection for U.S. GDP growth to 1.9 per
cent in 2007 and 2.1 per cent in 2008. U.S. growth is expected to pick up
to 3 per cent in 2009.
The Canadian dollar generally traded in a range of 93 to
"95.5 cents U.S. in July and August, but since then it has appreciated"
"sharply to as high as US$1.03. In the Bank’s new base-case projection,"
"the Canadian dollar is assumed to average 98 cents U.S., the midpoint"
"of the range since the July Update. As well, there has been a tightening"
of credit conditions stemming from financial market developments this
"summer. For Canada, the Bank assumes that the cost of credit for firms"
and households relative to the overnight rate will be 25 basis points
higher over the projection period than it was prior to the summer.
"Despite these tighter credit conditions, momentum in domestic de-"
mand in Canada is expected to remain strong. The combined effect
of a weaker U.S. outlook and a higher assumed level for the
"Canadian dollar implies, however, that net exports will exert a"
more significant drag on the economy in 2008 and 2009 than pre-
"viously expected. As a result, the Canadian economy is projected to"
"grow by 2.6 per cent in 2007, 2.3 per cent in 2008, and 2.5 per cent"
in 2009.
"With the economy moving back towards balance, and with the di-"
"rect effect of the stronger Canadian dollar on consumer prices, core in-"
flation is projected to gradually decline to 2 per cent in the second half
of 2008—slightly earlier than previously expected—and to remain
there for the balance of the projection period. Higher energy prices are ex-
pected to push total inflation up sharply in the fourth quarter of 2007 to
about 3 per cent. Inflation is then expected to fall back to the 2 per cent
target in the second half of next year and to stay there.
A number of the risks identified in the July Update have been real-
"ized to some extent. Stronger household demand in Canada, a sharper"
"adjustment in the U.S. housing sector, and a stronger Canadian dollar"
have been reflected in the Bank’s new base-case projection.
This report includes information received up to the ﬁxed announcement date on
16 October 2007.

But significant upside and downside risks to the Bank’s inflation
"projection remain. On the upside, excess demand in the Canadian"
economy could persist longer than projected. This could come from
two sources: higher growth in household spending than projected and
"lower growth in productivity than assumed. On the downside, if the"
Canadian dollar were to persist above the level of 98 cents U.S. as-
sumed over the projection horizon for reasons not associated with
"stronger-than-projected demand for Canadian products, this would"
"result in lower output and inflation. In addition, the effect of the past"
appreciation of the Canadian dollar on demand and inflation could be
"greater than expected, and the effect of the weakness in the U.S. hous-"
ing sector could be larger than projected.
"All factors considered, the Bank judges that the risks to its inflation"
"projection are roughly balanced, with perhaps a slight tilt to the down-"
side.
"In addition, the duration and economic repercussions of recent"
financial market developments and the possibility of a disorderly un-
winding of global imbalances represent an uncertainty for the outlook.
"Against this backdrop, the Bank left its key policy rate unchanged"
"on 5 September and 16 October at 4.50 per cent. The Bank judges, at this"
"time, that the current level of the target for the overnight rate is consis-"
tent with achieving the inflation target over the medium term.

2. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN INFLATION
Inflation and the 2 per cent target
The underlying rate of
inflation is running above
2 per cent . . .
The underlying rate of inflation has been above 2 per cent over
"the past year. Total CPI inflation, which has also been running"
"above 2 per cent since the spring, fell temporarily to 1.7 per cent in"
August as a result of fluctuations in the prices of some of the more
volatile components (Chart 1).
. . . reflecting ongoing
capacity pressures.
"The core rate of inflation,1 a more reliable indicator of the"
"underlying trend in inflation than total CPI inﬂation, has averaged"
"2.3 per cent over the past few months, as projected in the July"
Update. This reflected ongoing pressures on production capacity in
the economy. Other measures of the trend rate of inﬂation that the
Bank monitors also stayed above 2 per cent in July and August
(Chart 2).2 The influence of strong domestic demand was particu-
larly evident in the prices of core services (Chart 3). Shelter costs
"rose somewhat more strongly than projected, with greater-than-"
expected strength outside Alberta. Core food prices have also con-
"tinued to rise markedly, owing to the ongoing surge in the prices"
of grains and oilseeds. The downward pressure on the core rate
coming from lower prices for many import-intensive goods (such
"as semi-durable and household durable goods) eased still further,"
but price discounting on automobiles increased.
Total CPI inflation eased
temporarily to 1.7 per
cent in August.
The 12-month rate of increase in the total CPI was below that
"projected, owing to the prices of some of the more volatile compo-"
"nents. This included gasoline prices, which reflected narrower"
margins as a result of a faster-than-anticipated return of North
American production to more normal levels following supply dis-
ruptions last spring. Natural gas prices were also weaker.
Key measures of inflation
expectations remain close
to 2 per cent.
Key measures of inflation expectations remain close to 2 per
cent. The average private sector forecast for total CPI inflation in
2008 is just above 2 per cent. In the Bank’s autumn Business Out-
"look Survey, over 80 per cent of firms expected CPI inflation to be"
"within a range of 1 to 3 per cent, on average, over the next two"
1. The core measure of inﬂation excludes eight of the most volatile compo-
nents of the CPI and removes the effect of changes in indirect taxes on the
"remaining components. The eight volatile components are fruit, vegetables,"
"gasoline, fuel oil, natural gas, intercity transportation, tobacco, and mortgage"
interest costs.
2. CPIW is affected by changes in the GST and other indirect taxes. If this effect
"were removed, the rate of change of CPIW would have also been above 2 per"
cent from February to June of 2007.

years. Consensus forecasts of inflation over the longer term con-
tinued to be very close to 2 per cent.

Factors at work on inflation
Aggregate demand
Economic growth in Can-
ada was stronger than
expected in the first half
of 2007.
Growth in Canada’s real GDP picked up markedly in the first
"half of 2007, rising at an annual rate of 3.7 per cent. At 3.4 per"
"cent, the increase in real GDP in the second quarter was stronger"
than the 2.8 per cent projected in the July Update. This unexpected
strength reflected stronger household spending and a smaller-
than-expected drag from net exports.3 Available information for
the third quarter suggests that final domestic demand remained
strong but that the drag from net exports increased. Current data
also suggest that real GDP is likely to have grown by about
"2.5 per cent, slightly less than the 2.7 per cent projected in the last"
Update.
Final domestic demand
continued to be the major
contributor to GDP
growth . . .
Final domestic demand continued to be the major contributor
to GDP growth in the first half of 2007 (Chart 4). Real personal dis-
"posable income rose solidly, boosted by the strong labour market."
"Household net worth continued to rise, reflecting the improve-"
ment in Canada’s terms of trade and substantial increases in house
prices. And household credit again increased considerably. These
developments underpinned marked increases in household spend-
"ing, including residential investment (Technical Box 1). In contrast,"
the growth of capital spending by businesses slowed appreciably.

Recent Developments in the Canadian Housing Market
"Since the beginning of the year, residential investment in Canada has contin-"
"ued to show substantial momentum, supported by strong employment, sustained"
"income growth, relatively low interest rates, and accommodative mortgage terms"
and conditions (Chart A). This momentum has exceeded the Bank’s expectations.
Accompanying this robust activity has been greater-than-expected strength in
"prices, particularly in the resale market. Of note has been the large increase in"
resale house prices in the major markets in Alberta since 2005 (Chart B). While
"price increases have slowed in Calgary in 2007, with more supply coming on"
"stream, they have accelerated in Edmonton and have only recently shown signs of"
stabilizing. Price increases in Alberta remain high relative to the national average.
"But, even as increases in house prices have eased in Alberta, some other major"
"urban centres have seen renewed strength in resale prices in 2007. In particular,"
"prices have shown considerable strength in Saskatchewan, boosted by favour-"
"able economic conditions, positive net migration, and a limited supply of housing."
Canadian homeowners have taken advantage of higher house prices in recent
years to help ﬁnance consumption through home-equity borrowing. The Bank esti-
mates that the increased use of such ﬁnancing has been an important factor sup-
porting growth in real household spending over the past few years.

"In particular, spending in the oil and gas industry eased, largely as"
a result of the impact of lower natural gas prices on conventional
drilling activity.
. . . while net exports
exerted a drag.
Canada’s total exports increased moderately in the first half of
"2007, with strong gains in exports of energy commodities and"
"products. Weaker sales of U.S. motor vehicles, however, contrib-"
"uted to a decrease in Canadian exports of automotive products,"
while the downturn in the U.S. housing market held back exports
"of forest products. At the same time, imports rose more strongly"
"than exports, reflecting the strength of domestic demand and the"
appreciation of the Canadian dollar over the past few years.
"Nevertheless, the drag on growth coming from net exports in"
the second quarter of 2007 was less than expected. This outcome
"appears to have been caused by transitory developments, since"
early information for the third quarter points to a marked
reduction in net exports.
Aggregate supply
Hours worked in the business sector showed a year-over-year
"rise of 1.6 per cent in the second quarter of 2007, slightly less than"
the average growth over the previous three years. This slight
reduction in the growth of hours worked mainly reflected a
"decrease in the average workweek, while job creation remained"
relatively robust.
Labour productivity growth in the business sector rose at
"0.9 per cent at annual rates in the second quarter of this year,"

which was still modestly lower than the average growth over the
2004–06 period (Chart 5). This may be partly attributable to the
shift of labour and capital towards the production of both com-
"modities and non-tradable goods and services, since labour and"
capital may be somewhat less productive during such a period of
"adjustment. In the resource sector, relatively high commodity"
prices continued to encourage the production of resources that are
"more costly to extract, lowering productivity from what would"
have otherwise been the case.
Growth in potential out-
put is estimated to have
averaged about 2.5 per
cent over the 2004–06
period.
The Bank estimates potential output over history by decom-
posing movements in labour supply and labour productivity into
their trend and cyclical components. After updating its conven-
"tional measure with the most recent information, the Bank esti-"
mates that potential output growth over the 2004–06 period
"averaged about 2.5 per cent, marginally less than previously"
estimated.
Estimated pressures on capacity
Most indicators suggest
that the economy was
operating further above
its capacity limits in
the third quarter than
projected.
Most indicators suggest that the Canadian economy is operat-
ing further above its production potential than was projected at
the time of the July Update.

percentage of firms reporting that they would have difficulty in
meeting an unanticipated increase in demand remained at a high

level (Chart 6). The Bank’s conventional measure of the output
gap indicates that the economy was operating about 0.8 per cent
above its production potential in the third quarter of 2007
"(Chart 6), slightly higher than projected in the July Update.4 On the"
"other hand, Statistics Canada’s measure of capacity utilization in"
"the non-farm, goods-producing sector indicated that pressure on"
production capacity was somewhat below average in the second
"quarter of 2007. However, the fact that the core rate of inflation"
has averaged above 2 per cent since September 2006 supports the
assessment that the economy was operating above its production
capacity.
"In September, the employment-to-population ratio matched a"
"record high, while the unemployment rate was at a 33-year low."
All measures of wages have picked up in recent months and are
now more consistent with other indicators of tightness in labour
markets. The 12-month change in average hourly earnings of per-
manent workers reported by Statistics Canada in the Labour Force
"4. The level of excess demand in the third quarter of 2007, estimated using the"
"Bank’s conventional measure, is about 0.2 percentage points higher than pro-"
jected in the July Update. This increase reﬂects a small upward revision in the
projected level of real GDP in the third quarter and a small reduction in the
estimated level of production capacity.

Survey (considered to be a good indicator of the underlying
change in aggregate wages) moved back up to between 3 and

ada’s

Accounts—a
more
volatile
indicator—also
increased even more markedly to 5.7 per cent in the second quar-
ter of 2007 (Chart 5). With the strong gains in hourly compensa-
"tion in the business sector, unit labour costs in the second quarter"
of 2007 were up 4.8 per cent from their level a year earlier. The
percentage of firms reporting labour shortages in the Bank’s
autumn survey was up from the preceding survey.

judges that the economy
was operating about

"After reviewing all the indicators of capacity pressures, it is"

the third quarter of 2007.

"Over the past few months, global prices for non-energy commodi-"
"ties have eased a little from the peak reached in May, but, overall,"
"remain at high levels (Chart 8). Metals prices fell back, partly reflecting"
"the tightening in global credit conditions, but have since recovered. As"
"well, the ongoing downturn in the U.S. housing market has contrib-"
"uted to further reductions in the demand for lumber. In contrast, grains"

impact of unfavourable weather conditions on global supplies.
. . . but crude oil prices
have moved up.
"The price of light crude oil (West Texas Intermediate), which"
"was about US$72 per barrel at the time of the July Update, aver-"
aged US$81 in the 10 days ending on 12 October 2007. This
increase chiefly reflected the combination of continued vigorous
global demand and relatively little adjustment in short-term supply.
A rebound in the terms of
trade will support income
growth through 2007.
"Canada’s terms of trade rebounded in the ﬁrst half of 2007,"
reﬂecting substantial gains in the prices of non-energy commodities
"(Chart 9). As a result, the four-quarter change in the chain price index"
for GDP (a broad price measure of the goods and services produced in
Canada) increased from 0.9 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2006 to
3.5 per cent in the second quarter of 2007 (Chart 10). With the chain
price index for domestic demand growing at a slower 2.5 per cent
"pace in the second quarter, this implies a boost in real incomes in"
Canada.
The terms of trade are expected to stay high in the second half
"of 2007, and this should contribute to sustained growth in nominal"
"GDP and, hence, in corporate profits and government tax revenues."

3. FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Recent financial market
developments have led to
increases in credit
spreads.
"In recent months, greater-than-anticipated losses related to"
U.S. subprime mortgages have triggered a number of develop-
ments in global financial markets. There has been greater uncer-
"tainty about the valuation of structured financial products, and"
investors have shifted into lower-risk government bonds and
"treasury bills, causing credit spreads to increase. Financial institu-"
"tions and businesses in major industrialized countries, including"
"Canada, have faced higher short-term interest rates (Chart 11)."
"Against the background of these developments, the Bank of Can-"
ada has undertaken routine operations on a number of occasions
to provide liquidity in support of the efficient functioning of Can-
ada’s financial markets and to maintain the overnight rate close to
the 4.50 per cent target (Technical Box 2). Although the disloca-
tions
in
financial
markets
have
diminished
somewhat
since
"August, heightened uncertainty is still affecting money markets."
Credit conditions
Financial institutions are
facing unusually high
funding needs.
Canadian
financial
institutions
are
facing
substantially
increased funding needs. With the recent disruptions in securitiza-
"tion markets, banks have taken steps to support their own asset-"
"backed commercial paper programs and, as a result, most are"
holding substantially higher-than-normal amounts of this paper in
"inventory. In addition, banks are being called upon to provide"
loans and backup credit under pre-committed lines to corpora-
tions that have stopped accessing market funding. While Canadian

Implementing Monetary Policy: Targeting the Overnight Rate
The Bank of Canada’s monetary policy implementation framework centres on
keeping the overnight rate close to its target.1 The Bank’s primary inﬂuence on the
"overnight rate is through the 50-basis-point operating band, reinforced through its"
standing facilities for loans and deposits. In order to reinforce the target when the over-
"night rate deviates from it, the Bank uses open market buyback operations and changes"
in the level of settlement balances provided to the ﬁnancial system. If the overnight rate
"is generally trading above the target rate, the Bank will intervene with special purchase"
and resale agreements (SPRAs). If the overnight rate is generally trading below the tar-
"get rate, the Bank will intervene with sale and repurchase agreements (SRAs). In addi-"
"tion, to inﬂuence the overnight rate, the Bank can adjust the targeted level of settlement"
balances higher or lower than the typical $25 million setting.
"SPRAs are routinely conducted around month-, quarter-, and year-end periods, and"
"when large payment ﬂows are going through the system. The Bank used SPRAs, SRAs,"
"and adjustments to settlement balances, as appropriate, during episodes in 1999, during"
"the transition to the Large Value Transfer System (LVTS), and in early 2006, when there"
was persistent downward pressure on the overnight rate.
"Since early August, the Bank has again been using these tools to counter upward"
pressure on the overnight rate and keep it close to target.

banks have sufficient capital and liquidity available to meet their
"funding commitments, they are incurring higher funding costs,"
which have led to tighter credit conditions. This tightening is
"reflected in the price, availability, and terms of credit for busi-"
"nesses and households (Technical Box 3). For some businesses,"
"however, the upward pressure on the overall cost of capital ema-"
nating from higher borrowing costs has been mitigated somewhat
"by some downward pressure on the cost of equity financing, given"
buoyant stock markets.
Credit conditions have
tightened modestly.
Growth of both business and household credit accelerated in
"July and August from already robust levels (Chart 12). Since then,"
banks have modestly tightened their terms of credit to firms and
the pricing of credit to both firms and households. These develop-
ments are likely to have a dampening effect on borrowing.
Growth of the broad monetary aggregates has remained robust
since the July Update and points to upward pressure on inflation
through 2008 (Chart 13).

The Cost and Availability of Credit in Canada
"Credit conditions in Canada have tightened since late July, reﬂecting a repric-"
ing of risk as investors have become less willing to hold a wide variety of private
"sector securities, most notably asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP). The degree"
of tightening in terms of changes in the availability and cost of ﬁnancing for finan-
"cial institutions, ﬁrms, and households is difﬁcult to estimate. Since the situation"
"is still evolving, estimates are subject to a high degree of uncertainty. But what is"
"clear is that the costs of borrowing from the market or from banks has increased,"
and credit conditions have tightened.
The cost of funding for Canadian banks through various market instruments
has risen 10 to 35 basis points relative to the rates observed at the end of July.
Increases in the costs of deposits have been more modest.
Some borrowing rates posted by ﬁnancial institutions have increased over the
past few months. Effective borrowing rates for both business and consumers have
also increased as the extent to which discounts on posted rates offered to house-
"holds and businesses, such as the prime rate, have diminished. In addition, some"
"ﬁnancial institutions have increased covenants on new loans, and others have indi-"
"cated some reduction in new loan originations. All told, the effective costs of"
household and business loans from ﬁnancial institutions are estimated to have
increased by about 20 to 35 basis points.
Businesses’ cost of borrowing through ﬁnancial markets has also increased
somewhat since July. The overall cost of issuing short-term market debt is esti-
mated to have increased by roughly 20 to 30 basis points. Based on observed
"prices, the cost of long-term debt is estimated to have remained largely unchanged,"
but the actual amount of issuance has been relatively small and remains limited to
"investment-grade borrowers.1 As a result, observed prices likely do not fully reﬂect"
actual borrowing conditions. When the different components of bank and market
"borrowing are aggregated, the weighted average cost of borrowing for non-ﬁnan-"
cial ﬁrms has increased by at least 15 to 25 basis points.
"Overall, the cost of borrowing for households and businesses is estimated to be"
"about 25 basis points higher, relative to the overnight rate, than it was prior to the"
"summer developments, and availability and terms of credit have tightened mod-"
estly.
1.
Given that the yields on government debt have fallen slightly more than the increase in risk spreads
"over the past few months, the interest cost on corporate debt to investment-grade corporations has"
fallen.

Policy interest rates and exchange rates
The U.S. policy rate was
lowered by 50 basis
"points on 18 September,"
and short-term rates
incorporate expectations
of modest rate cuts.
"In the United States, the Federal Reserve lowered the target for"
"the federal funds rate by 50 basis points on 18 September, and"
short-term rates embody expectations of a further modest reduc-
tion in coming months. Markets are pricing in a likelihood of a
modest hike in policy rates by the European Central Bank and the
"Bank of Japan in coming months (Chart 14). In Canada, market"
"expectations, based on short-term interest rates, currently suggest"
little change in the policy rate in the coming months.
The Canadian dollar has
appreciated considerably
since the last Update
against a backdrop of
broad-based weakness in
the U.S. dollar.
"Through July and August, the Canadian dollar generally"
traded in the range of 93 to 95.5 cents U.S. assumed in the July
"Update, but since then has appreciated sharply, moving as high as"
US$1.03 (Chart 15). The recent movement partly reflects the broad-
based weakness in the U.S. dollar (against the currencies of its
main trading partners with flexible exchange rates). This has
occurred against the background of a weaker outlook for eco-
nomic growth and inflation and a lower policy interest rate in the
"United States. In addition, the Canadian dollar continues to be"
"supported by firm commodity prices, particularly oil, and strong"
"domestic demand. That said, the magnitude of the recent appreci-"
ation appears to have been stronger than historical experience
would have suggested.

4.THE OUTLOOK
This section describes the Bank’s outlook for the global and
Canadian economies through 2009. Underlying the base-case pro-
"jection are a number of key assumptions. First, it is assumed that"
"over the projection period, the Canadian dollar will average"
"98 cents U.S., the midpoint of the range since the July Update of"
"93 to 103 cents U.S. Second, energy prices are assumed to evolve"
"along a path that is consistent with current futures prices. Third,"
global credit conditions are assumed to remain tighter. For Can-
"ada, it is assumed that the cost of credit to firms and households, rela-"
"tive to the overnight rate, will remain around 25 basis points higher"
overall than it was prior to the recent financial market turbulence.
"Fourth, trend labour productivity in Canada is assumed to grow at"
1 1
"/2 per cent over the projection period. Finally, an orderly adjustment"
of global imbalances is assumed.
International background
The global economy con-
tinues to grow at a solid
pace.
The global economy expanded at a strong pace in the first
"three quarters of 2007, led by developing economies. Annual aver-"
age global economic growth for 2007 is now projected to be some-
"what higher than in the July Update. Over 2008 and 2009, the"
strength of global economic growth is still expected to ease mod-
estly (Table 1).

Economic growth in
Japan and the euro zone
is projected to be close
to potential growth.
Economic growth in Japan and the euro zone has been slightly
"weaker than expected, but the slowdown in investment that"
"underlies this weakness is likely to be short lived, since business"
"balance sheets and profits are generally strong. In addition, ongo-"
ing improvements in labour markets will continue to support
"household spending. Overall, economic growth in Japan and the"
euro zone is expected to be close to their growth in potential over
"the next few years, despite some near-term effects related to cur-"
rent financial conditions and weaker U.S. demand. Economic
growth in the United Kingdom has been stronger than anticipated
"in the first half of the year, but recent financial events are expected"
to slow growth to closer to potential over the near term.
Growth remains strong in
China and emerging Asia.
"In China and emerging Asia, growth remains strong. Inflation-"
"ary pressures appear to be building in China, with higher prices"
for basic commodities such as food and energy. Chinese authori-
ties have implemented measures to restrain aggregate demand
"and price increases, although further actions are assumed."
The projection for U.S.
GDP growth has been
revised down for 2007
and 2008.
The projection for U.S. GDP growth has been revised down to
"1.9 per cent in 2007 and 2.1 per cent in 2008, considerably weaker"
than the 2.1 and 3.0 per cent projected in the July Update. The
economy is then expected to rebound in 2009. The outlook for the
U.S. economy now incorporates a more pronounced and pro-
tracted slowdown in domestic demand. The recent evidence of
larger-than-expected declines in activity in the U.S. housing sector
implies a deeper and more prolonged adjustment in residential
investment relative to earlier projections. The weakness in the housing
"sector is expected to reduce other consumption expenditures, but"
this impact will be somewhat mitigated by the recent lowering of
"U.S. interest rates. At the same time, the cumulative real effective"
depreciation of the currency will continue to boost U.S. net
exports and will also provide some offset to the weaker domestic
demand overall. In light of recent downward revisions to histori-
cal growth in real GDP and labour productivity in the United
"States, the Bank has revised down its estimate of potential output"
growth to 2.8 per cent for 2007 and to 2.6 per cent over the rest of
the projection period. This implies that the excess supply currently
present in the U.S. economy is expected to be eliminated by the
end of 2009.
Prices of non-energy
commodities are likely
to remain relatively
"high, although declining"
somewhat further.
"Consistent with the outlook for global growth, the price index"
for non-energy commodities is expected to decline somewhat over
the projection horizon but still be higher than was anticipated in
"the July Update. In particular, increases in the global capacity to"
"produce metals are likely to be slower than was earlier expected,"
but some further modest easing of prices from the very high level
reached in the second quarter is still projected. The prices for

25
grains and oilseeds are now expected to be higher than previously
"envisaged, while lumber prices are expected to remain low."
Oil prices futures suggest
a gradual decline in oil
prices to around US$74 in
2009.
Spot prices and futures prices for crude oil have moved up
since July (Chart 16). Prices for crude oil are expected to be near
"US$80 per barrel through early 2008, before easing to around"
"US$74 per barrel in 2009. On the other hand, futures prices for"
"natural gas are lower than in the last Update, especially over the"
near term.
Aggregate demand and supply in Canada
Canada’s GDP growth is
projected to be 2.6 per cent
"in 2007, 2.3 per cent in 2008,"
and 2.5 per cent in 2009.
"The Bank’s current base-case projection for Canada, when"
"compared with that in the July Update, sees the level of economic"
"activity higher at mid-2007, but growth somewhat weaker through"
the second half of 2007 and the first half of 2008 (Table 2). Contin-
"ued robust growth in incomes, supported by high commodity"
"prices and tight labour markets, is expected to sustain robust"
growth in domestic demand. But three factors are expected to
dampen the projection for GDP growth: the weaker U.S. economic
"outlook, the higher assumed level for the Canadian dollar and, to"
"a much lesser degree, the impact of the modest tightening of"
credit conditions. Quarterly growth is expected to average just
"over 2 per cent in the second half of 2007 and the first half of 2008,"
before edging up close to the growth of production capacity by

"the beginning of 2009 (Chart 17). GDP growth, on an average"
"annual basis, is projected at 2.6 per cent in 2007, before easing to"
2.3 per cent in 2008 and then moving up to 2.5 per cent in 2009.
Growth in final domestic

Growth in final domestic demand is expected to continue to
contribute importantly to economic expansion in the second half
of 2007 and through 2008 and 2009.
Consumer spending is projected to grow solidly over the pro-
jection period as a result of ongoing gains in both real disposable
"income and household net worth. Housing investment, after a fur-"
"ther moderate increase to a very high level this year, is projected"
"to decline slightly in 2008. In this base-case outlook, the tightening"
of credit conditions is tempering the momentum in household spend-
ing.
The tightening of credit conditions is also expected to lead some
businesses to postpone some capital spending into 2009. Factors con-
tributing to continued growth in business investment include
"pressures on production capacity, high levels for many commodity"
"prices, strong proﬁtability and solid balance sheets, and decreased"
prices of imported machinery and equipment.
The real growth of government spending on goods and serv-
ices is expected to average just under 3 per cent through 2009.
Net exports are projected
to exert a larger drag on
growth than was the case
in the July Update.
While the growth in imports is expected to be robust over the
"projection period, the growth of Canadian exports is expected to"
"be weak, owing to the projected slower growth of U.S. domestic"
demand to the end of 2008 and to the higher assumed level of the

"Canadian dollar. In particular, the tightening of credit conditions"
in the U.S. mortgage market will have a larger and more persistent
"adverse impact on demand for Canadian exports, especially build-"
"ing materials and consumer goods.5 On balance, net exports are"
expected to exert a larger drag on overall growth than was the
case in the last Update.
With labour supply growth declining by about 0.1 per cent per
"year from 1 1/4 per cent in 2008, and trend productivity assumed"
"to grow at a rate of 1 1/2 per cent, the assumption for potential"
"output growth is 2.8 per cent in 2008 and 2.7 per cent in 2009, as in"
the July Update.
The Canadian economy is
projected to remain in
excess demand through to
early 2009.
The degree of pressure on production capacity at the begin-
ning of the projection period is slightly higher than in the July
"Update. With these growth profiles for GDP and potential output,"
the economy would remain in excess demand through to early
"2009. In this base-case projection, there is no change in the policy"
interest rate. The effects of a weaker U.S. outlook and the higher
"assumed Canadian dollar, combined with a modest tightening in"
"credit conditions, more than offset the stronger momentum in"
"domestic demand, bringing aggregate demand back into line with"
aggregate supply a little more quickly than projected in the July
Update.
5. The Bank’s base-case projection for the United States incorporates a
decrease in real residential investment of about 15 per cent in 2007 and 11 per
"cent in 2008. Estimates based on reduced-form models suggest that, all else"
"being equal, this would translate into an adverse impact on Canadian real GDP"
of about 0.4 percentage points in 2007 and 0.3 percentage points in 2008. See
Technical Box 1 in the April Monetary Policy Report for similar analysis.

The outlook for inflation
Core inflation is expected
to return to 2 per cent in
the second half of 2008.
The core rate of inflation is expected to remain above 2 per
"cent through mid-2008, and then ease to 2 per cent in the second"
"half of next year, staying there for the remainder of the projection"
"period (Table 3). With weaker economic growth, excess demand"
pressures are expected to gradually dissipate. This should contrib-
"ute to more moderate growth in the price of services, and the con-"
tribution to inflation coming from rising house prices is expected
to diminish. The direct impact of the stronger Canadian dollar is
also expected to contribute to modest additional downward pres-
"sure on inflation through lower import prices, and, as a result, the"
core rate is expected to return to the 2 per cent target a little ear-
lier than in the last Update.
Total CPI inflation is
expected to move up tem-
porarily to about 3 per
cent in late 2007 and then
move back close to 2 per
cent in the second half of
2008.
The outlook for the 12-month rate of increase in the total CPI
reflects both the slightly revised projected track for core inflation
and expectations for energy prices. Total CPI inﬂation in the ﬁrst
"half of 2008 is somewhat higher than in the last Update, owing to"
higher futures prices for crude oil. Total CPI inﬂation is expected to
rise sharply over the remainder of this year to about 3 per cent in the
fourth quarter. This reﬂects both the impact of the reduction in gaso-
line prices in late 2006 and the recent rise in spot and futures prices
"for crude oil, although this latter effect is tempered by the exchange"
"rate appreciation and narrower margins seen recently. Thereafter,"
total CPI inﬂation is expected to move back close to the 2 per cent
target in the second half of 2008 and stay there over the remainder
of the projection period.

Risks to the outlook
There have been a number of significant economic and finan-
cial developments since the July Update. Reflecting these develop-
"ments, a number of the risks to the Bank’s projection identified at"
that time have been realized to some extent. Stronger household
"demand, a sharper adjustment in the U.S. housing sector, and a"
stronger Canadian dollar have been reflected in the Bank’s new
"base-case projection. This being said, significant upside and down-"
side risks to the Bank’s projection for inflation remain.
The main upside risk
relates to the persistence
of excess demand in the
economy.
"On the upside, the excess demand in the domestic economy"
"may persist longer than projected, putting upward pressure on"
inflation. This risk could come from two sources: higher growth in
household spending than projected and lower growth in produc-
"tivity than assumed. The solid growth in household income, the"
acceleration in the growth of household credit and broad mone-
"tary aggregates, and the continued strength in house prices all"
point to the risk of greater momentum in household spending.

Weaker growth in labour productivity would translate into lower
potential output growth than assumed in the base-case projection
"and, hence, greater upward pressure on unit labour costs and"
inflation.
The main downside risk is
that the Canadian dollar
could be persistently
higher than the assumed
average level.
"On the downside, if the Canadian dollar exchange rate were to"
persist above the assumed level of 98 cents U.S. over the projec-
tion horizon for reasons not associated with stronger-than-pro-
"jected demand for Canadian products, Canadian output and"
"inflation would be lower. In addition, the base-case projection"
might underestimate the implications for demand for Canadian
goods and services of the cumulative effect of the past apprecia-
"tion of the exchange rate, given the considerable adjustment it"
entails for the Canadian economy. Prices for consumer goods
could be lower than projected if competitive pressures induce a
greater pass-through of the exchange rate appreciation. There is
also a possibility that the more pronounced slowdown in the U.S.
housing sector could have a larger-than-projected impact on con-
"sumption, further reducing U.S. demand for Canadian exports."
The risks to the inflation
projection are roughly
"balanced, with perhaps a"
slight tilt to the down-
side.
"All factors considered, the Bank judges that the risks to the"
"projection for inflation are roughly balanced, with perhaps a slight"
tilt to the downside.
The future evolution and economic repercussions of ongoing
global financial market developments represent an uncertainty for
the outlook. There also remains a small probability of a disorderly
resolution of global imbalances.
