Canada’s infl
ation-control strategy
Infl
ation targeting and the economy
""

The objective of Canada’s monetary policy is to promote the
economic and fi
nancial well‑being of Canadians. Canada’s
experience with infl
ation targeting since 1991 has shown that the
best way that monetary policy can achieve this goal is by maintaining
a low and stable infl
ation environment. Doing so fosters confi
dence
"in the value of money and contributes to sustained economic growth,"
a strong and inclusive labour market and improved living standards.
""

"In 2021, the Government of Canada and the Bank of Canada"
renewed the fl
exible infl
ation‑targeting strategy of the monetary policy
framework for a further fi
"ve‑year period, ending December 31, 2026.1"
""

The infl
ation target was renewed at the 2% midpoint of the 1%–3%
"control range, with infl"
ation measured as the 12‑month rate of
change in the consumer price index (CPI).
""

The Government and the Bank agreed that the best contribution
monetary policy can make to the economic and fi
nancial
well‑being of Canadians is to continue to focus on price stability.
The Government and the Bank also agreed that monetary policy
"should continue to support maximum sustainable employment,"
recognizing that maximum sustainable employment is not directly
measurable and is determined largely by non‑monetary factors
that can change through time.
""

"Further, the Government and the Bank agreed that because well‑"
anchored infl
ation expectations are critical to achieving both price
"stability and maximum sustainable employment, the primary objective"
"of monetary policy is to maintain low, stable infl"
ation over time.
Infl
ation targeting is symmetric and ﬂ
exible
""

Canada’s infl
"ation‑targeting approach is symmetric, which means"
the Bank is equally concerned about infl
ation rising above or falling
below the 2% target.
""

Canada’s infl
ation‑targeting approach is also ﬂ
"exible. Typically,"
the Bank seeks to return infl
ation to target over a horizon of six to
"eight quarters. However, the most appropriate horizon for returning"
infl
ation to target will vary depending on the nature and persistence
of the shocks buffeting the economy.
""

The 2021 agreement with the Government specifi
es that the 2%
infl
ation target remains the cornerstone of the framework.
""

The agreement further notes that the Bank will continue to use the
fl
exibility of the 1%–3% control range to actively seek the maximum
"sustainable level of employment, when conditions warrant. The Bank"
will also continue to leverage the fl
exibility inherent in the framework
to help address the challenges of structurally low interest rates by
using a broad set of policy tools. The Bank will use this fl
exibility only
to an extent that is consistent with keeping medium‑term infl
ation
expectations well anchored at 2%.
Monetary policy tools
""

Because monetary policy actions take time to work their way through
the economy and have their full effect on infl
"ation, monetary policy"
must be forward‑looking.
""

The Bank normally carries out monetary policy through changes
in the target for the overnight rate of interest (the policy rate). The
Bank also has a range of monetary policy tools it can use when the
policy rate is at very low levels. These tools consist of guidance on
"the future evolution of the policy rate, large‑scale asset purchases"
"(quantitative easing and credit easing), funding for credit measures,"
and negative policy rates. The potential use and sequencing of these
tools would depend on the economic and fi
nancial market context.
""

All of the Bank’s monetary policy tools affect total demand for
Canadian goods and services through their infl
uence on market
"interest rates, domestic asset prices and the exchange rate. The"
balance between this demand and the economy’s production
"capacity is, over time, the main factor that determines infl"
ation
pressures in the economy.
Communications
""

"Consistent with its commitment to clear, transparent communications,"
the Bank regularly reports its perspectives on the economy and
infl
ation. Policy decisions are typically announced on eight pre‑set
"days during the year, and full updates of the Bank’s outlook are"
published four times each year in the Monetary Policy Report.
""

The Bank is committed to explaining when it is using the fl
exibility of
the infl
ation‑targeting strategy.
""

Given the uncertainty about the maximum sustainable level of
"employment, the Bank will consider a broad range of labour market"
indicators.2 The Bank will also systematically report to Canadians on
how labour market outcomes have factored into its policy decisions.
Monitoring infl
ation
""

"In the short run, the prices of certain CPI components can be"
particularly volatile and can cause sizable fl
uctuations in CPI infl
ation.
""

"In setting monetary policy, the Bank seeks to look through such"
transitory movements in CPI infl
ation and focuses on a set of “core”
infl
ation measures that better refl
ect the underlying trend of infl
ation.
"In this sense, these measures act as an operational guide to help the"
Bank achieve the CPI infl
ation target. They are not a replacement for
CPI infl
ation.
""

The Bank’s three preferred measures of core infl
"ation are CPI‑trim,"
which excludes CPI components whose rates of change in a given
"month are the most extreme; CPI‑median, which corresponds to"
the price change located at the 50th percentile (in terms of basket
"weight) of the distribution of price changes; and CPI‑common, which"
uses a statistical procedure to track common price changes across
categories in the CPI basket.

Overview
Overview
"The Canadian economy has strong momentum, and employment is robust."
"While COVID‑19 continues to affect people’s health and the economy, high"
vaccination rates are lessening severe impacts. Household consumption
spending is strengthening as most public health containment measures are
"being lifted, and exports are expected to benefit from solid foreign demand."
The unprovoked Russian invasion of Ukraine is causing enormous human
suffering and has introduced significant uncertainty to the outlook for the
global economy. The effects of the war are weighing on global activity and
have resulted in greater volatility in financial markets. The war has also
pushed commodity prices higher and further disrupted supply chains.
"As a result, inflation has increased in most economies, including Canada’s."
"Energy and food prices continue to rise, and ongoing supply constraints"
are interacting with robust demand to put upward pressure on a broadening
range of prices.
Key messages
""
 The outlook for CPI inflation in Canada is higher than previously projected.
Inflation is expected to average just below 6% through the first half of 2022
and remain well above the control range through the rest of the year. It should
then steadily decline to about 2½% in the second half of 2023 and to the 2%
"target in 2024. This decline reflects decreases in energy prices, a dissipation"
of global supply chain constraints and a rebalancing of supply and demand in
the Canadian economy.
""
 Labour market conditions in Canada are tight. Employment and
"participation rates are near or above their pre-pandemic levels, and the"
"unemployment rate is at a record low. Overall, the Canadian economy is"
moving into excess demand.
""
 Canadian economic activity is expected to remain strong. Consumer
"spending, exports and business investment are projected to grow solidly."
"This is supported by healthy foreign demand, high commodity prices and"
the easing of supply disruptions.
""
 Higher interest rates should moderate spending and gradually reduce
excess demand in the Canadian economy.
""
" Alongside an easing of supply challenges, high immigration levels and"
a solid recovery in business investment are expected to support strong
potential output growth.
""
 The Bank is paying particular attention to how inflation expectations are
"evolving. While long-term expectations remain anchored on the target,"
near-term expectations have risen along with inflation.

Global economy
Global economy
Russia’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine is taking a tragic human toll. It is
also disrupting the global economic recovery just as most economies are
emerging from the impact of the Omicron variant of COVID‑19. The war has
exacerbated global supply shortages by restricting global transportation and
"imports of products from both Ukraine and Russia. Consequently, the prices"
"of oil, grains and other commodities have risen sharply, and financial volatility"
has increased.
The global outlook has been downgraded from the January Report (Box 1).
Revisions are pronounced for oil-importing economies and regions with
"closer trade ties to Russia and Ukraine, particularly Eastern Europe and, to a"
"lesser extent, the euro area. The US outlook has also been revised down due"
largely to the anticipated tightening of monetary policy in response to higher-
than-expected inflation.
Box 1
Changes to the economic projection since the January Report
Global GDP outlook
Projected growth in global gross domestic product
(GDP) in 2022 remains roughly unchanged relative to
the January Report. The negative effects of the war
in Ukraine are roughly offset by a smaller drag from
COVID‑19 containment measures in emerging‑market
economies. Global growth for 2023 has been revised
down signifi
cantly because the negative consequences
of the war are expected to persist through higher
commodity prices as well as trade and fi
nancial
channels. The downward revision to the US outlook
also refl
ects a faster and more pronounced tightening
of monetary policy in response to higher‑than‑expected
infl
"ation. Overall, the level of global GDP at the end of"
2023 has been revised down by about 1%.
Canadian GDP outlook
GDP growth is revised up by about ¼ percentage
point to 4¼% in 2022 and revised down by about
"¼ percentage point to 3¼% in 2023. Overall, these"
revisions leave the level of real GDP roughly unchanged
by the end of 2023.
Higher energy prices have led to positive revisions to
exports and investment in the oil and gas sector. These
revisions are roughly offset by the effect of lower foreign
demand on non‑commodity exports and the impact from
higher interest rates on household spending.
Canadian CPI infl
ation outlook
Consumer price index (CPI) infl
ation is anticipated to
be substantially higher than projected in January. The
outlook for CPI infl
ation is revised up by 1.1 percentage
points to 5.3% in 2022 and by 0.5 percentage points to
2.8% in 2023. These revisions are primarily related to
"the consequences of the invasion of Ukraine, which has"
driven up commodity prices and exacerbated supply
disruptions.

BANK OF CANADA  •  Monetary Policy Report  •  April 2022
Global growth is projected to moderate from about 7% in 2021 to 3½% in
2022 and 2½% in 2023 (Table 1). This should occur as the bounce back in
activity from the acute phase of the pandemic wanes and the Russia–Ukraine
conflict weighs on the outlook. The Bank expects global growth to strengthen
to 3¼% in 2024 once the war’s initial impact on growth subsides.
Inflation continued to rise in the first quarter and remains high in most
"regions, with strong positive contributions from energy and food prices"
(Chart 1). Robust demand for goods and widespread supply shortages also
remain important sources of inflationary pressure globally.

BANK OF CANADA  •  Monetary Policy Report  •  April 2022
Sharp increase in commodity prices
Russia and Ukraine are significant exporters of commodities. Market
concerns about supply disruptions caused by the war in Ukraine have led to a
sharp rise in most commodity prices (Chart 2).
Oil prices have been volatile since the January Report. Before Russia’s
"invasion, oil prices were already rising because oil demand was outpacing"
"the growth in supply. The Russian invasion led to sharply higher prices, with"
the daily price of Brent crude oil peaking at nearly US$130 a barrel in early
March. The Brent oil price has since fallen to around US$105 as the scope of
sanctions on Russian oil has become clearer and the United States and other
countries announced large releases of their strategic petroleum reserves.
The recent COVID‑19 outbreak in China has also raised concerns about the
strength of oil demand.
The Bank assumes that the price of Brent crude oil will fall from US$105
per barrel in the second quarter of 2022 to about US$90 at the end of 2024
(Box 2). West Texas Intermediate and Western Canadian Select crude oil
"prices are assumed to follow similar patterns, remaining US$5 and US$15,"
"respectively, below Brent prices. This profile assumes that the war’s impact"
on oil prices diminishes over time and is broadly consistent with market
expectations.
Uncertainty around the assumed outlook for oil prices is particularly high.
Prices could rise further if Russian oil exports are weaker than expected or if
global oil production does not increase enough to meet demand. A resolution
"of the conflict in Ukraine, a rapid increase in global production or a drop in oil"
consumption could lead to a faster decline in prices.

BANK OF CANADA  •  Monetary Policy Report  •  April 2022
Box 2
Key inputs to the projection
The Bank of Canada’s projection is always conditional
"on several key assumptions, and changes to these will"
affect the outlook for the Canadian economy. The Bank
regularly reviews these assumptions and how they may
impact the economic projection. The key inputs into the
Bank’s projection are as follows:
""
 Public health restrictions have been largely removed
in many countries. It is assumed that remaining
measures will be lifted over the course of 2022 for
most of the world. Containment measures in China
are expected to loosen more gradually—and even
periodically tighten—over 2022.
""
" In Canada, most public health restrictions have been"
lifted. Pandemic‑related effects on demand—notably
consumer caution and reluctance to travel—are
assumed to fade over 2022 and 2023.
""
" As in the January projection, spending on household"
consumption is assumed to be boosted by an additional
$40 billion as individuals draw down a portion of the
extra savings accumulated during the pandemic.
""
 The projection does not incorporate the measures
announced in the April 2022 federal budget.
Preliminary analysis suggests the budget’s impact will
be positive but modest relative to the Bank’s projection.
""
 Oil prices are assumed to decrease over the
projection horizon from their current elevated levels.
The price of Brent stays near its recent average
of US$105 per barrel in the second quarter of
2022 before declining to about US$90 by the end
of 2024. The prices for West Texas Intermediate
(WTI) and Western Canadian Select (WCS) follow
"similar dynamics, with a constant spread below the"
"price for Brent of US$5 and US$15, respectively."
"In the January Report, the prices were assumed to"
"be US$80 for Brent, US$75 for WTI and US$65 for"
WCS.
""
" By convention, the Bank does not forecast the"
exchange rate in the Monetary Policy Report. As in
"the January Report, the Canadian dollar is assumed"
"to remain at 79 cents US over the projection horizon,"
close to its recent average.
""
 The pandemic is having both temporary and lasting
effects on the supply side of the Canadian economy.
"As in recent reports, the Bank distinguishes between"
supply and potential output to account for the
relatively short‑lived nature of some of the decrease
"in supply caused by pandemic‑related factors, such"
as public health measures and supply disruptions.
""

The Bank’s assessment of potential output
"growth, a longer‑term concept, looks through the"
short‑lived effects of pandemic‑related factors.
Potential output growth (excluding temporary
factors) is assumed to average about 2% per
year over 2022–24. Details on the Bank’s
assessment of potential output growth are
provided in the Appendix on page 28.
""

The projection assumes that short‑term factors
are reducing the supply of goods and services.
"For instance, supply disruptions are assumed to"
"reduce supply, with a peak impact of about 2%"
in both the fourth quarter of 2021 and the fi
rst
quarter of 2022 and a still‑elevated impact of 1¾%
in the second quarter. This effect is anticipated
"to dissipate by mid‑2023, two quarters later than"
"assumed in January. Moreover, measures taken"
to contain the Omicron variant of COVID‑19
coupled with elevated worker absences due to
the rise in cases are estimated to have decreased
supply temporarily in the fi
rst quarter of 2022 (see
Chart 13 on page 19).
""

Estimates of overall growth in supply can be
obtained by combining the estimates of the
temporary effects of these short‑term factors with
the assessment of potential output. Supply growth
is projected to average about 2½% over 2022–24.
""
 Gross domestic product (GDP) is estimated to have
grown at a stronger‑than‑potential pace in the fi
rst
quarter of 2022 amid elevated supply disruptions.
"As a result, the Bank estimates that the output"
gap—the difference between GDP and supply—
was between ‑0.25% and 0.75% in the fi
"rst quarter,"
higher than the estimate of ‑0.75% to 0.25% for the
fourth quarter of 2021.
""
 The nominal neutral policy interest rate is defi
ned as
the real neutral rate plus 2% for infl
ation. The real
neutral rate is defi
ned as the rate consistent with
both output remaining sustainably at its potential
and infl
"ation remaining at target, on an ongoing"
basis. It is a medium‑ to long‑term equilibrium
"concept. In this Report, the Bank has updated its"
estimated range of the nominal neutral interest
rate in conjunction with the annual reassessment
of potential output. This range is judged to be
0.25 percentage points higher than assessed
"in April 2021 (see Appendix). For Canada, the"
projection is based on the assumption that the
nominal neutral rate is at the midpoint of the revised
range of 2% to 3%.

BANK OF CANADA  •  Monetary Policy Report  •  April 2022
The Bank’s non-energy commodity price index has increased by about
10% since the January Report. The increase in prices of base metals and
agricultural commodities mainly reflects the supply disruptions caused
by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. While unchanged relative to the January
"Report, lumber prices remain high because of strong housing demand in"
North America and continued transportation bottlenecks. Markets expect
non-energy commodity prices to remain elevated over the projection horizon
because of uncertain supply from Russia and Ukraine as well as strong
global demand.
More volatile financial markets
"Financial conditions have tightened since the January Report, mainly as a"
result of higher current and expected interest rates in many regions. Increased
uncertainty about the impact of the war in Ukraine has also led to more
"volatility in the prices of many financial assets. In early March, in response"
"to the invasion of Ukraine, corporate credit spreads widened and most"
equity price indexes dropped sharply. Credit spreads and equity prices have
returned to near pre-war levels in most regions. Canadian equity indexes have
outperformed those of other countries due to their high exposure to energy and
other commodities. The Canadian dollar has been relatively stable against the
US dollar despite rising commodity prices (Box 2).
Expectations of higher inflation and tighter monetary policy have pushed up
"yields of government bonds globally, in particular for short-term bonds. This"
has narrowed the spread between long- and short-term government bond
yields in North America.
Broad inflationary pressure in the United States
US domestic demand has been growing at a robust pace. Job gains remain
strong amid a tight labour market. Nominal wage growth continues to be
"vigorous, but high inflation is eliminating gains in real compensation."
"US gross domestic product (GDP) is forecast to expand by 2¾% in 2022, well"
above the estimated rate of potential output growth (see the Appendix on
page 28). Because the United States is a net exporter of petroleum products
"and has limited trade exposure to Russia and Ukraine, the war should have"
only a modest negative impact on growth. Consumption is anticipated to rise
"at a healthy pace, supported by employment growth and some household"
spending of the savings accumulated during the pandemic. Solid private
domestic demand should also drive robust business investment growth.
"Recent increases in mortgage rates are, however, expected to dampen"
growth in residential investment. GDP growth is projected to moderate to
about 2% in 2023 and 1½% in 2024 as US authorities withdraw fiscal and
monetary policy stimulus.
Total and core measures of US personal consumption expenditures (PCE)
inflation have continued to increase and are at their highest levels in nearly
40 years. Large increases in energy prices as well as supply constraints amid
high demand for goods continue to be important contributors to inflationary
"pressures. Relative to the January Report, delivery times have shortened"
"modestly, and order backlogs are slowly being cleared (Chart 3). However,"
shipping and input costs remain high. The war is expected to exacerbate
pressures on supply chains and put additional upward pressure on inflation
"in the near term. In the projection, the Bank assumes that supply challenges"
continue to ease but persist until mid‑2023. Inflation is projected to start
decreasing in the third quarter but is expected to stay above 2% over the
projection horizon as the economy remains in excess demand.

"In response to strong inflationary pressures, the Federal Reserve raised"
the federal funds rate by 25 basis points in March. It also announced that
additional increases will be needed and that it will begin reducing its holdings
of Treasury and other securities in the near future.
Growing headwinds in the euro area
Household and business confidence in the euro area are being hit hard by
"the increased uncertainty caused by the war in Ukraine, higher energy prices"
and continuing supply challenges. GDP is nevertheless expected to grow at a
faster pace than potential output over the projection horizon as the economy
continues to recover from the pandemic.
Both core and total inflation have risen more quickly than anticipated in recent
months and are now well above target. Higher energy and food prices explain
"a significant portion of the recent increase, although inflationary pressure has"
become more broad-based across goods and services. The recent increase
in energy prices and additional supply constraints related to the invasion of
Ukraine are expected to push inflation higher in the near term.
Modest growth in China
China’s GDP is expected to grow at a modest pace of 4¼% in 2022. Growth
is held back in large part by the ongoing correction of its property market
and stringent measures to contain a resurgence of COVID‑19. Housing
"markets remain weak, reflecting soft demand and uncertainty about the"
financial viability of major property developers. High energy prices should
also weigh on household and business spending. Chinese stock markets
"recently reacted sharply to concerns about regulatory changes, financial"
vulnerabilities and the geopolitical implications of the war in Ukraine. Policy-
makers have announced steps to improve confidence and shore up markets.

BANK OF CANADA  •  Monetary Policy Report  •  April 2022
Growth is projected to recover to about 5% in 2023 and 2024 as the drag
on growth from the property sector diminishes. Uncertainty remains high
about both the impact of China’s “zero‑COVID” policy and the fragility of the
property sector. Either of these factors could dampen growth by more than
expected over the projection horizon.
Weaker growth in emerging-market economies and
the rest of the world
Oil-importing emerging-market economies (EMEs) are recovering from the
"impact of the Omicron variant more quickly than expected. However, the"
war in Ukraine and high energy prices are expected to severely hamper
"growth in 2022 and 2023. Within the group, emerging Europe will be most"
"affected because of its proximity to the conflict, its closer trade ties with both"
Ukraine and Russia and the war’s direct impact on Ukraine’s economy. In
"some EMEs, the drag from rising energy prices should be partially offset by"
increased revenues from exports of non-energy commodities. Higher interest
rates in many EMEs in response to increasing inflationary pressures are also
weighing on growth prospects.
Growth in the rest of the world group will be held back by the sharp
"contraction of the Russian economy due to economic sanctions. However,"
other oil-exporting countries are expected to benefit from increased oil
revenues.

Canadian economy
Canadian economy
The Canadian economy continues to grow strongly. Growth in the second
"quarter is being boosted by the removal of public health restrictions, solid"
foreign demand and higher commodity prices.
"Labour markets are tight. Employment growth has been strong, with jobs more"
than recovering from the effects of the Omicron variant of COVID‑19. Labour
"shortages are widespread across firms, leading to rising wage growth."
A broad set of indicators suggests that slack has been absorbed and the
economy is moving into excess demand. Faced with robust demand and supply
"constraints, firms are raising prices in response to higher input costs. This"
increases the risk that expectations of elevated inflation could become entrenched.
"Overall, economic growth is robust and moderates through the projection"
horizon. Growth is expected to be 4¼% this year before slowing to a solid
"pace of 3¼% in 2023. A recovery in services consumption, exports and"
"investment supports growth (Table 2). At the same time, alongside the"
"easing of supply constraints, strong investment and population growth are"
projected to strengthen potential output growth. In response to ongoing
"inflationary pressures, higher interest rates are expected to moderate growth"
in domestic demand to better align it with the growth of supply. GDP growth
is projected to ease to about 2¼% in 2024.

BANK OF CANADA  •  Monetary Policy Report  •  April 2022
The war in Ukraine is affecting the Canadian economy predominantly through
higher commodity prices (Box 3). Households are feeling this impact through
"increased prices for gasoline, fuel oil and food."
Consumer price index (CPI) inflation is forecast to average just under 6%
in the first half of 2022. Factors driving inflation include sharp increases in
energy and food prices as well as supply disruptions and strong demand for
goods. As these pressures dissipate and monetary policy accommodation is
"removed, CPI inflation is anticipated to ease to about 2½% in the second half"
"of 2023 before declining to the 2% target in 2024. In this projection, inflation"
is both higher and more persistent than in the January Report (Box 1).
Box 3
Th
e impact of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on the Canadian economy
"In addition to its tragic human toll, the war in Ukraine"
is negatively affecting economies around the world.
"However, for commodity exporters, the negative impacts"
on global growth are offset by the effects of higher
commodity prices.
The confl
ict is affecting Canadian economic activity and
infl
ation through several channels (Table 3‑A).
Impacts from higher commodity prices
"For a net commodity exporter such as Canada, rising"
commodity prices are typically associated with a
boost to economic activity and increased infl
ationary
pressures. Higher commodity prices affect the following
channels:
""
 Terms of trade: The prices of Canada’s exports
should increase. This improvement in the terms of
trade means more income fl
owing into Canada—
which can be spent on domestic and imported
goods and services.
""
" Commodity production: Production, exports and"
"investment in commodity‑related sectors will rise,"
supporting Canadian employment and incomes.
""
 Direct consumer price index (CPI): Some
"components of the CPI, such as gasoline, natural"
"gas, food and transportation, will face a direct"
impact.
""
 Production costs: These costs rise whenever
commodities are used as inputs. This is expected to
dampen economic activity and contribute to further
infl
ationary pressures.
"In the current context, the boost to Canadian economic"
growth from higher energy prices may be more
subdued. The pickup in production and investment in
the oil and gas sector is expected to be muted given
"uncertainty about long‑term demand. Moreover, while"
commodity exporters will benefi
"t from higher prices,"
the overall impact on global growth is anticipated to be
"negative. As a result, softer demand for Canada’s non‑"
commodity exports is expected to offset some of the
anticipated lift from higher commodity prices.
"While economic activity will increase less than usual,"
the impacts on infl
ation may be larger. The Canadian
dollar typically strengthens with rising commodity prices.
A stronger dollar would usually dampen infl
ationary
pressures by lowering the domestic price of imported
products relative to domestically produced goods and
"services. Currently, however, the Can$/US$ exchange"
rate has remained relatively unchanged since the start
of the war.
Further stress on global supply chains
The war and the resulting trade restrictions are expected
to worsen and prolong some global supply chain
"disruptions, especially for commodities. While the"
"magnitude of this effect is uncertain, it will weigh on the"
"recovery in global growth, and prices will face additional"
upward pressure.

BANK OF CANADA  •  Monetary Policy Report  •  April 2022
Stronger second-quarter growth
Economic growth is expected to pick up to about 6% in the second quarter of
2022 from a solid pace of 3% in the first quarter (Table 3 and Chart 4). The
effects of the Omicron variant weighed on economic activity in the first weeks
"of the year, but these effects were short-lived, and household consumption"
was resilient. Growth is on track for a strong consumption-led pickup in the
second quarter as pandemic restrictions are removed. This is despite supply
disruptions and labour shortages continuing to hold back the production and
availability of a wide range of goods (Chart 5).
Housing market activity remained strong in the first quarter. The pandemic-
"induced increase in demand for more housing space, along with still-low"
"borrowing rates and high disposable income, has boosted activity. Resales"
are expected to soften somewhat in the second quarter as borrowing rates
rise. Low levels of both builders’ inventories and existing homes for sale
should support new construction and renovations in the near term.
Box 3 (continued)
The course of the war and its implications for economic
activity are highly uncertain. As long as commodity
"prices remain elevated, they will support some"
increased investment and activity in the resource sector.
They will also boost domestic income and aggregate
"demand. However, these effects are likely to be"
dampened by softer global growth and more persistent
supply chain disruptions.
"In addition, other factors could become important"
"depending on how the situation evolves. For example,"
immigration levels could rise with the movement of
refugees from the confl
ict. Supply reductions and price
increases in global energy and commodity markets
"could also have long‑term implications for investment in,"
"and the development of, alternative sources."
Implications for infl
ation
The implications of the war in Ukraine for infl
ation in
Canada are clear and large. These include the impacts
"of commodity‑linked prices, increased production costs"
and more pervasive supply chain disruptions. Together
these add 0.7 percentage points to CPI infl
ation in 2022.

Exports and business investment are expected to grow strongly in the
second quarter as they continue to recover toward pre-pandemic levels.
Higher energy prices are boosting growth in energy exports and investment
"(Chart 6). Outside the energy sector, solid foreign demand and a rebound in"
exports of motor vehicles are supporting exports.
Tight labour markets
Employment bounced back sharply in recent months. Overall measures
of labour market health are strong when compared with a wide range of
"benchmarks.1 For instance, employment and total hours worked have"
"surpassed pre-pandemic levels (Chart 7). Moreover, many of the groups hit"
"hardest by the pandemic have seen robust recoveries, notably young women."
In the Bank of Canada’s Business Outlook Survey (BOS) for the first
"quarter of 2022, indicators of labour shortages remain elevated. Most firms"
experiencing labour shortages expect them to persist until at least 2023.
While roughly two-thirds of respondents plan to increase the size of their
"workforce to meet strong demand, many cited difficulty finding workers."
Wage growth has risen to near pre-pandemic levels (Chart 8). Wage growth
"is expected to increase further alongside elevated job vacancies, workers’"
increased willingness to switch jobs and a record-low unemployment rate.
"The strengthening in wages is consistent with the latest BOS, where firms"
report having difficulty attracting and retaining staff.

BANK OF CANADA  •  Monetary Policy Report  •  April 2022
Canadian economy moving into excess demand
A broad set of measures suggests that economic slack has been absorbed
and that the economy is starting to operate beyond its productive capacity.
Canadian firms are increasingly facing capacity pressures amid a tight
labour market and pervasive supply chain challenges. Roughly 8 out of
10 respondents to the BOS said they would have difficulty meeting an
unexpected increase in demand—a new survey high (Chart 9). More firms
intend to pass cost increases related to supply chain disruptions and rising
wages into their output prices. Core measures of inflation have all risen
materially above 2%.
"Taking these respective demand and supply pressures into account, the"
Bank estimates that the output gap has risen to between ‑0.25% and 0.75%
"for the first quarter of 2022, up from the estimate of ‑0.75% to 0.25% for the"
last quarter of 2021 (Box 2). With robust growth expected in the second
"quarter, the economy is moving into excess demand."
CPI inflation at multi-decade high
Elevated energy and food prices are expected to push CPI inflation to just
under 6% in the first half of 2022 (Chart 10). Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has
"driven up commodity prices. In Canada, households are feeling this through"
"higher prices for gasoline and fuel oil. The impacts on the cost of wheat, corn"
"and soybeans will also boost food prices in coming quarters, compounding"
the effects of last year’s drought and supply bottlenecks.
"Pervasive supply constraints, together with strong global and domestic"
"demand, are also contributing to the rise in prices of a wide range of goods"
"and services (Box 4). As a result, price pressures are broadening, with about"
two‑thirds of CPI components growing above 3% (Chart 11).

Box 4
Domestic and global determinants of infl
ation in Canada
Consumer price index (CPI) infl
ation hit a three‑decade
"high in February 2022, reaching 5.7% on a year‑over‑"
year basis. The run‑up in infl
ation refl
"ects global factors,"
"such as strong demand and supply chain disruptions,"
as well as domestic factors. Understanding the impacts
of these factors can help better assess how long
infl
ationary pressures will remain elevated and how to
adjust the response in Canadian monetary policy.
Goods infl
"ation hit 7.6% in February, twice as high as"
services infl
"ation. Oil prices are set in global markets,"
and the pass‑through to the price of gasoline in Canada
is typically rapid and high. Domestic food prices are also
affected because they are linked to global agricultural
prices as well as domestic crop conditions and local
supply constraints. Energy and food price infl
ation
"are at 24% and 7.4%, respectively; together, they are"
contributing roughly 2.5 percentage points to CPI
infl
ation.
Durable goods prices have also been rising quickly
(Chart 4‑A). Shortages of semiconductor chips are
leading to lower production of and higher prices for
motor vehicles—a clear global supply shock. In other
"durable goods markets, strong global demand is playing"
"an important role, compounded by supply challenges."
"Two examples are furniture and household appliances,"
which together make up nearly 3% of the CPI. Prices for
these goods have been rising quickly alongside sales.
"In contrast, domestic factors are the key driver for"
services prices. Although infl
ation of these prices is
"running well below that of goods prices, it has also"
picked up. The strongest gains have been seen in
"homeowners’ replacement costs, which are rising at"
a pace close to 13% (Chart 4‑B). While the inputs for
"construction, such as lumber and copper, refl"
ect global
"factors, housing is also infl"
uenced by domestic demand
"and supply conditions. These include demand factors,"
"such as population growth, historically low borrowing"
rates and an increased preference for more housing
"space. They also include supply constraints, such as"
"labour shortages and, in some cases, limited availability"
of land for development. The strength in housing price
infl
ation is also fi
nding its way into rent infl
"ation, which"
has risen to over 4%.

Measures of core inflation continue to rise alongside widening inflationary
"pressures, with CPI-trim, CPI-median and CPI-common at 4.3%, 3.5% and"
"2.6%, respectively (Chart 12). The increases reflect more widespread price"
pressures and are consistent with an economy that is moving into excess
demand.
"Other services prices, however, are rising at a"
"slower pace. For example, child care and personal"
"care services are growing at less than 2% and 3%,"
"respectively, because price developments in these"
categories primarily refl
ect pressures on domestic
"wages. Moreover, some categories, such as"
"communications, have seen prices fall despite higher"
real spending because of ongoing digitalization.
"Overall, the pickup in infl"
ation has been concentrated
in traded goods prices. This refl
ects both global
and domestic conditions. Domestically driven price
pressures have emerged in services prices. We see
"this in homeowners’ replacement costs, rents and other"
services as the economy is moving into excess demand.

Strong economic growth and easing inflation
"Growth is projected to be 4¼% in 2022, easing to a still-solid pace of 3¼% in"
"2023, supported by robust domestic demand and exports. The tight labour"
market and improved terms of trade are expected to boost aggregate income
"and wealth. In turn, high income and a drawdown of some pandemic-related"
"savings will drive domestic spending. In addition, an increase in potential"
output will further support growth in domestic income and demand.
Pandemic-related restrictions and supply disruptions have weighed on
"output. With employment growing faster than output, productivity growth"
"has been weak. However, public health restrictions have now been largely"
"removed, and supply disruptions are expected to dissipate gradually by"
mid‑2023 (Chart 13). As caution around the pandemic fades and supply
"shortages ease, GDP is expected to grow faster than employment, and"
output per worker to rise.
"Together with robust business investment and higher immigration, this rise"
in labour productivity growth is projected to boost supply growth from about
1¾% this year to roughly 3¼% in 2023 (see Appendix on page 28). This will
provide room for solid economic growth with declining inflation.
Higher interest rates in Canada and the normalization of monetary policy
globally are expected to moderate domestic demand growth. GDP and
"supply growth will both ease to about 2¼% and 2½%, respectively, in 2024."

Expansion led by strong consumption growth
Job gains and the spending of some of the savings accumulated during the
"pandemic will support consumption growth (Chart 14). Moreover, the lifting of"
public health restrictions should lead to a continued rebound in spending on
hard-to-distance services in the second half of 2022. Consumption of these
"services will grow at a slower but still-solid pace thereafter, as pandemic-"
induced caution fades.
"In contrast, overall goods consumption is forecast to grow at a more"
"moderate pace. As a result, the balance of consumption between goods and"
services will return toward pre-pandemic levels over the projection horizon.
"While consumption growth for most goods will moderate, spending on motor"
vehicles should pick up as supply challenges in the auto sector are resolved.
Housing activity is projected to ease from its current level but remain
"elevated, supported by population growth. Resales are expected to soften"
as borrowing rates rise and the pandemic-induced demand for more housing
"space wanes. Meanwhile, the unwinding of supply chain bottlenecks should"
support new construction as sourcing building materials becomes easier.
"This growth in housing supply, combined with slowing demand, should help"
rebalance housing markets over time and help moderate house price growth.

Robust export growth
"Export growth is expected to be strong in 2022 and 2023, boosted by"
elevated commodity prices and solid foreign demand coupled with easing
"supply constraints (Chart 15). Later in the projection, exports are anticipated"
to continue to grow but at a slower pace.
Energy exports are projected to grow strongly because of high prices and
increased transportation capacity. Canadian producers are expected to make
full use of existing production and transportation capacity to boost energy
"exports in 2022. Expansions in crude-by-rail and pipeline capacity, including"
"the scheduled completion of the Trans Mountain Expansion project, will"
support growth later in the projection horizon.
"Non-energy goods exports should grow solidly, supported by the gradual"
"dissipation of global supply disruptions. However, exports of motor vehicles"
"are expected to remain flat after the second quarter of 2022, reflecting supply"
"issues, before declining later in the projection due to restructuring in the"
sector. Services exports and imports are anticipated to strengthen as travel
"recovers, but the recovery is expected to take time given the slow return of"
international tourism.
Goods imports will be supported by strong domestic demand as well as the
willingness of firms to invest and rebuild inventories as supply chain issues
ease.
Stronger business investment after pandemic lows
Business investment is expected to grow strongly (Chart 16). Investment
growth in the oil and gas sector is anticipated to be robust as a result of high
energy prices. Heightened global concerns over secure energy supplies
"should also benefit Canadian producers. However, investment will be"
restrained by labour shortages and ongoing uncertainty about long-term
demand and the transition to a low-carbon economy.

"Outside the oil and gas sector, investment will be supported by robust"
"demand, the gradual easing of supply constraints and improved business"
"confidence. The outlook is consistent with the results of the BOS, as most"
businesses said they intend to increase their spending on machinery and
equipment. This level of investment intentions was a near-record high for the
survey. More firms also reported plans to invest in digital technologies and
automation to improve productivity given tight labour markets and rising input
costs.
Inventory investment is projected to contribute to growth in 2022 and 2023 as
"businesses, notably retailers, restock following pandemic shortages."
CPI inflation to decline from second-quarter peak
Inflation is expected to ease over the projection horizon as the effects of high
energy prices and supply disruptions fade and monetary policy tightening
moderates demand (Chart 17).
"With oil prices assumed to decline after the second quarter of 2022, the"
boost from higher gasoline prices should fade quickly in coming quarters.
Upward pressure from supply challenges is also expected to dissipate
over 2023. This is consistent with the assumption that the prices for goods
affected by supply challenges will not experience price reversals. This
anticipated easing in inflationary pressures can be seen in the dynamic of
"annualized quarter-over-quarter inflation rates, which fall from around 6%"
in the second quarter of 2022 to about 2½% in the fourth quarter. Year-
over-year inflation is anticipated to decrease from about 5¾% in the second
quarter of 2022 to about 2½% in the second half of 2023. Inflation is then
expected to decline to the 2% target in 2024.

BANK OF CANADA  •  Monetary Policy Report  •  April 2022
Rising short-term and stable long-term inflation
expectations
Inflation has been above 3% since the second quarter of 2021. When
"combined with the outlook, this suggests that inflation is expected to be"
above the top end of the inflation control range for two years. There is a
concern that high and persistent inflation can affect long-term inflation
expectations. This matters because inflation expectations are an important
factor behind future inflation.
The inflation expectations of consumers have increased at the one‑year
horizon (Chart 18). Evidence about the evolution of inflation expectations
at the two‑year horizon is mixed. Inflation expectations of professional
"forecasters remain relatively stable, but those of consumers and businesses"
have increased significantly. Most respondents to both the BOS and the

anticipate inflation will be well above 3% on average over the next two years.
"Current high inflation has not, however, resulted in increases in survey-"
based expectations at longer horizons. Most respondents to the BOS
anticipate inflation will be close to the 2% target in three years because of
improvements in supply chains and the Bank’s interest rate actions. Inflation
expectations also remain relatively stable at the five‑year horizon for both
consumers and professional forecasters.2
2	 It is common in household surveys of inflation that the absolute level is higher than the inflation target.
"As such, it is the directional change that matters most. For instance, see C. D. Carroll, “Macroeconomic"

The five‑year break-even inflation rate (BEIR) has increased to near 3%. At
"this level, the five-year BEIR is consistent with a rise in inflation over the near"
"term followed by a decline toward the 2% target. In this respect, the five‑year"
BEIR is indicative that longer-term inflation expectations are consistent with
the Bank’s projection for inflation.

Canada’s balance sheet
Canada’s balance sheet
"Since November 2021, the Bank has been in the reinvestment phase."
This means that the Bank has been purchasing Government of Canada
(GoC) bonds solely to replace maturing bonds. This requires approximately
"$4 billion to $5 billion in purchases every month, across both the primary and"
secondary markets.
Ending the reinvestment phase and initiating quantitative tightening means
that the Bank will stop purchasing GoC bonds. Maturing bonds will not be
"replaced when they roll off the balance sheet. As a result, the Bank’s balance"
"sheet will shrink over time, with roughly 40% of the Bank’s GoC bond"
holdings maturing within the next two years.
The longer-run level of settlement balances will be higher than it was before
"the pandemic. This reflects a variety of factors, including a shift in investor"
"preferences toward safe and liquid assets, changes to the payment system"
in Canada and regulatory requirements that encourage greater use of central
bank deposits.

Risks to the inflation outlook
Risks to the inflation outlook
"The disruptions related to the COVID‑19 pandemic have diminished, but"
Russia’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine has introduced a major new source
"of uncertainty. Global trade is being disrupted, confidence is declining, and"
"financial markets have been volatile. Moreover, the tragic situation in Ukraine"
has ignited fears of wider escalation and risks to global economic integration.
A quick end to the war would be positive for global growth and would reduce
"inflationary pressures. In contrast, a prolonged or worsening conflict would"
"lower confidence, add further stress to supply chains and boost inflation."
"Regarding COVID‑19, greater population-wide immunity has led to the"
removal of public health restrictions and the reopening of economies in
most jurisdictions around the world. While the likelihood of another severe
"downturn has diminished, the virus continues to circulate and mutate. Even"
"without a resurgence of cases, reopening an economy remains complex, and"
pervasive supply constraints have yet to be unwound.
Some of the risks identified in previous reports have been partially
"incorporated into the projection. For example, the base-case scenario"
includes more persistent supply-side disruptions and an upward revision to
residential investment.
"Outside of the pandemic and the war in Ukraine, the Bank sees several"
upside and downside risks to the outlook for inflation. The Bank views these
"risks as roughly balanced. Nonetheless, the upside risks are of greater"
concern because inflation is very high. Until inflation moves significantly
"lower, there is an elevated risk that Canadians will start to believe that it will"
stay high over the long term. Higher inflation expectations could in turn lead
to more pervasive increases in labour costs and inflationary pressures and
could become embedded in ongoing inflation.
"Drawing from a larger set of risks, the Bank presents here a selection of"
those identified as most important for the projected path of inflation.
(i)
More persistent supply bottlenecks and cost pressures (↑)
Disruptions such as the spread of COVID‑19 variants could further affect
"manufacturing and shipping activities, causing persistent shortages of"
"goods and labour. In particular, some countries that have had relatively"
"low infection rates to date, such as China, could be subject to more"
frequent and widespread lockdowns. A drawn-out war in Ukraine could
also create additional supply bottlenecks or worsen existing ones even
"further. Over time, repeated disruptions to business operations may lead"
firms to adjust their supply chains in ways that could increase costs.
More persistent labour shortages could also result in wages rising much
"faster than productivity growth. Taken together, these effects would lead"
to greater and longer-lasting inflationary pressures.
""
Risks to the inflation outlook	 26
""
""
BANK OF CANADA  •  Monetary Policy Report  •  April 2022
(ii)
Reversal of growth in goods prices (↓)
The base-case scenario assumes that the sharp increase in the level
of prices of durables seen since the pandemic began will persist.
"However, as supply chain bottlenecks dissipate, these prices could"
"decline. Moreover, oil prices and transportation costs could decrease"
"more sharply, or goods consumption could slow faster than projected."
"If this occurred, inflation would be lower than projected."
(iii)	 Stronger household spending in Canada (↑)
The projection continues to include some degree of caution around
"consumption. However, further reductions in pandemic-related"
uncertainty could boost confidence by more than expected.
"Consequently, households could spend more of their accumulated"
savings. Consumption and residential investment would then be
stronger than projected and would contribute to greater inflationary
pressures.
(iv)	 Sharp deterioration of global financial conditions (↓)
"Global indebtedness levels, equity valuations and inflationary"
"pressures are all high. These, combined with reduced policy support,"
could result in a pullback in risk appetite and a sharp tightening of
global financial conditions. This would constrain access to credit for
"vulnerable EMEs or other highly indebted borrowers. In addition,"
China’s efforts to address vulnerabilities and engineer a soft landing
in the property sector could weigh on financial markets more than
expected. These shocks could have negative spillover effects on the
global economy and would be transmitted to the Canadian economy
"through a sharp tightening of financial conditions, weaker exports,"
lower commodity prices and a deterioration in the terms of trade.

Potential output in Canada and globally is expected to strengthen over the
projection horizon (Table A‑1). Relative to the April 2021 Monetary Policy
"Report, the Bank of Canada’s estimate of potential output growth in Canada"
has been revised down for 2021 and revised up for 2022 to 2024.
The estimated range for the Canadian nominal neutral rate of interest
has been revised up by 25 basis points compared with the April 2021
assessment. This reflects a combination of a higher global neutral rate and a
stronger outlook for potential output.3

Modest increase in global potential output growth
Global potential output growth is expected to continue recovering from the
"pandemic, rising from 2.7% in 2021 to 2.9% over the following three years"
"(Table A‑1). The recovery is observed in all regions except China, where"
"potential output growth should continue moderating, largely reflecting"
"population aging and slower capital accumulation. In the United States,"
potential output growth is expected to rise from 1.3% in 2021 to 1.8% in
2024. This increase is mainly due to easing immigration restrictions and
accelerating trend labour productivity growth as impacts from the pandemic
fade and firms invest in new and digital technologies.
"Compared with the April 2021 assessment, global potential output growth"
is marginally lower over the projection horizon. This reflects downward
"revisions to potential output for China, the United States and emerging-"
market economies. These downward revisions are partially offset by upward
revisions for other regions.
Canadian potential output growth to strengthen
"In Canada, the growth of potential output, including the effects of temporary"
"factors, is expected to decline from 2.3% in 2021 to 1.7% in 2022 because"
of lingering supply chain issues.4 It is then projected to increase to 2.7% on
average over 2023 to 2025. The resolution of supply disruptions explains
"much of this anticipated pickup, alongside stronger population growth due to"
higher immigration levels.
"Relative to the April 2021 assessment, potential output growth (including"
"temporary factors) is revised down by 1.4 percentage points in 2021, but"
is revised up by an average of 0.6 percentage points over 2022 to 2024
(Table A‑2).
"4	 In this Report, the Bank also uses the term “supply” when referring to potential output including the"
"effects of temporary factors. For more details, see Box 2."

The downward revision in 2021 largely reflects pressures from global supply
chain disruptions that emerged over the year and that are expected to
remain elevated in the first half of 2022 before gradually easing. The faster-
than-anticipated labour market recovery and lower expected impact of the
pandemic on labour market scarring contribute to upward revisions in trend
labour input from 2022 to 2024.
Potential output is highly uncertain because some of its components are
"unobservable and difficult to forecast. To reflect this uncertainty, a range is"
constructed around midpoint estimates. The outlook for potential output is
"subject to both upside and downside risks. In particular, Russia’s invasion of"
"Ukraine could have a larger-than-anticipated impact on global supply chains,"
weighing on potential output growth even more.
International travel and quarantine restrictions that are still in place in many
countries could continue to present challenges for Canada in reaching its
"immigration targets, posing a downside risk to growth in trend labour input."
"In contrast, refugees from Ukraine, who to date are concentrated throughout"
"Europe, could migrate to Canada in greater numbers than currently expected,"
which may strengthen potential output.
Higher neutral rate of interest
The Bank estimates that the nominal neutral rate in Canada currently
"lies in a range of 2% to 3%, 25 basis points higher than in the April 2021"
assessment.5 This upward shift reflects a combination of the revised US
"neutral rate (described below) and key domestic factors, including stronger"
growth of trend labour input and trend output over the long term.6
The small open nature of the Canadian economy implies that its neutral
"rate is linked with the global neutral rate, which the Bank proxies using an"
estimate of the US neutral rate. The Bank’s estimate for the nominal US
"neutral rate currently lies within a range of 2% to 3%, 25 basis points higher"
than in the April 2021 assessment.7 This is largely because the medium-term
impact of the COVID‑19 recession on US income inequality is now projected
to be smaller than that estimated in April 2021.
"5	 Unlike the potential output assessment, the Bank’s neutral rate assessment is conducted only on a"
forward-looking basis. It therefore aims to estimate the level of the neutral rate consistent with Bank
staff’s current medium- to long-term outlook rather than with a complete historical path.
