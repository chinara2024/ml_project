CANADA’S INFLATION-CONTROL STRATEGY
Inflation control and the economy
• Inflation control is not an end in itself; it is the means whereby monetary
policy contributes to solid economic performance.
• Low inflation allows the economy to function more effectively. This con-
tributes to better economic growth over time and works to moderate
cyclical fluctuations in output and employment.
The monetary policy instrument
• Announcements regarding the Bank’s policy instrument—the target over-
"night interest rate—take place, under normal circumstances, on eight pre-"
specified dates during the year.
"• In setting a target for the overnight rate, the Bank of Canada influences"
short-term interest rates to achieve a rate of monetary expansion consis-
tent with the inflation-control target. The transmission mechanism is com-
plex and involves long and variable lags—the impact on inflation from
changes in policy rates is usually spread over six to eight quarters.
The targets
"• In February 1991, the federal government and the Bank of Canada jointly"
announced a series of targets for reducing total CPI inflation to the mid-
point of a range of 1 to 3 per cent by the end of 1995. That inflation-con-
"trol target range was extended a number of times, most recently in May"
"2001, in this last case to the end of 2006. Monetary policy will continue to"
aim at keeping future inflation at the 2 per cent target midpoint of this
"range, both to maximize the likelihood that inflation stays within the tar-"
get range and to increase the predictability of inflation over the longer
term (Crawford 2001).
Monitoring inflation
"• In the short run, a good deal of movement in the CPI is caused by transi-"
tory fluctuations in the prices of such volatile components as fruit and
"gasoline, as well as by changes in indirect taxes. For this reason, the Bank"
focuses on a core measure of CPI inflation that excludes eight of the most
volatile components of the CPI and adjusts the remaining components to
remove the effect of changes in indirect taxes. Core inflation also tends to
be a better predictor of future changes in the total CPI than does the recent
history of CPI inflation (Macklem 2001).

1. OVERVIEW
The global economy has continued to grow at a robust pace
since the July Monetary Policy Report Update. Canada’s economic
growth in the first half of the year was somewhat stronger than
"had been expected. Overall, the economy now appears to be oper-"
ating at full production capacity.
"At the same time, the global and Canadian economies have"
continued to experience significant movements in energy prices.
While the spikes in crude oil and gasoline prices caused by hurri-
"canes in the Gulf of Mexico have already reversed, prices for natu-"
"ral gas and heating oil, as well as gasoline, are substantially"
higher than they were at the time of the July Update.
"As well, the Canadian dollar has been trading in a higher"
"range against the U.S. dollar since late summer, and has strength-"
ened even further against other major currencies. This recent
"strength appears to be underpinned by fundamental factors,"
including high prices for crude oil and natural gas and Canada’s
generally solid economic performance.
Past and recent movements in energy prices and in the
"exchange rate for the Canadian dollar, along with competitive"
"pressures from China and other newly industrialized economies,"
are giving rise to significant ongoing adjustments in the Canadian
economy. This has resulted in considerable variation in the growth
"patterns of sectors and regions, making an assessment of overall"
capacity pressures and of the future growth of potential output
particularly complex. Given these adjustments and the slow
"growth of productivity in recent years, the Bank has slightly"
reduced its estimate of potential output growth for 2005 and 2006.
The Bank’s base-case projection sees the Canadian economy
remaining at capacity through 2007. Real GDP is expected to grow
at about the same pace as potential output over the projection
"period, averaging 2.8 per cent in 2005, 2.9 per cent in 2006, and"
3 per cent the following year.
With the economy operating at capacity and with the increase
"in energy prices, pressures on consumer prices are somewhat"
stronger than they were at the time of the July Update. The annual
rate of increase in the consumer price index (CPI) probably spiked
above 3 per cent in September. On the assumption that energy
"prices evolve in line with currently prevailing futures prices, CPI"
inflation is projected to average close to 3 per cent for the rest of
2005 and for the first half of 2006 before returning to the 2 per cent
"target in the second half. In contrast, core inflation should remain"
below 2 per cent in coming months. But with the economy operating

rate since the July

at capacity and longer-term inflation expectations appearing to be
"well anchored, the Bank expects core inflation to return to 2 per"
cent by mid-2006.
The Bank’s base-case outlook for output and inflation is sub-
ject to a number of risks and uncertainties. Over the next four to
"six quarters, these risks include the adjustment of the Canadian"
"economy to global developments, uncertainty about the current"
"level and future growth of potential output, and the evolution of"
energy prices. These short-term risks appear to be balanced. But as
"we look further out to 2007 and beyond, there are increasing risks"
that the unwinding of global economic imbalances could involve a
period of weak global growth.
The Bank raised its key policy interest rate by 25 basis points
"on 7 September and again on 18 October, bringing it to 3 per cent"
(Chart 1).
"In line with the Bank’s outlook, and given that the Canadian"
"economy now appears to be operating at capacity, some further"
reduction of monetary stimulus will be required to maintain a bal-
ance between aggregate supply and demand over the next four to
"six quarters, and to keep inflation on target. However, with risks"
to the global outlook tilted to the downside as we look to 2007 and
"beyond, the Bank will monitor international developments partic-"
"ularly closely. More generally, the Bank will continue to assess the"
"adjustments and underlying trends in the Canadian economy, as"
"well as the balance of risks, as it conducts monetary policy to keep"
inflation on target over the medium term.

2. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN INFLATION
Total CPI inflation
averaged slightly above
2 per cent in the first eight
months of 2005.
The 12-month rate of increase in the total CPI showed consider-
able volatility over the ﬁrst eight months of 2005 and averaged just
over the Bank’s 2 per cent inflation-control target. The core rate of
"inflation,1 an indicator of the underlying trend, averaged 1.6 per"
cent over the same period.
Inflation and the 2 per cent target
Total CPI inflation has
"shown some volatility,"
reaching 2.6 per cent in
August 2005.
The 12-month rate of increase in the total CPI showed marked
"volatility in the first half of 2005, moving in a range of 1.6 to"
2.4 per cent. This mainly reflected fluctuations in gasoline prices.
"Indeed, with the further substantial rise in crude oil prices since"
"late May, total CPI inflation reached 2.6 per cent in August. It"
likely spiked above 3 per cent in September as a result of the surge
in gasoline prices following disruptions to U.S. refinery produc-
tion caused by recent hurricanes.
Core inflation and other
measures of trend infla-
tion remained below
2 per cent.
The core rate of inflation was 1.7 per cent in August (Chart 2).
This was the rate projected for the third quarter in the July Update.
Other measures of the trend rate of inflation that the Bank follows
also continued to be below 2 per cent (Chart 3).
1. The core measure of inﬂation excludes eight of the most volatile compo-
nents of the total CPI and adjusts the remaining components to remove the
"effect of changes in indirect taxes. The eight components are fruit, vegetables,"
"gasoline, fuel oil, natural gas, intercity transportation, tobacco, and mortgage-"
interest costs.

Decreases in the global prices of various consumer goods and
"the past appreciation of the Canadian dollar, which have contrib-"
"uted to declines in the prices of many import-intensive goods,"
have remained an important source of downward pressure on core
inflation so far in 2005. Fluctuations in motor vehicle prices have
accounted for much of the short-term movement in the core rate of
inflation.
Factors at work on inflation
Aggregate demand in Canada
Economic growth was
stronger than expected in
the first half of 2005 . . .
Real GDP increased at an annual rate of 2.7 per cent in the first
"half of 2005, faster than expected at the time of the July Update."
"Thus, the level of activity at mid-year was slightly higher than"
anticipated. The Bank’s monitoring of available information and
its assessment of the modest adverse economic effects arising from
the recent hurricane-induced disruption of the U.S. economy point
to Canadian GDP growth of about 3 per cent in the third quarter
of 2005.
. . . as final domestic
demand rose strongly . . .
Final domestic demand continued to show strong gains in the
"first half of 2005 (Chart 4). Moreover, net exports were little"
"changed, on balance, following a substantial reduction in the sec-"
ond half of last year.

. . . and exports recovered
while import growth
eased.
The recovery in Canada’s exports in the first half of the year
was supported by strong economic growth in the United States.
"The appreciation of the Canadian dollar through 2003 and 2004,"
which had contributed importantly to the decline in exports in the
"second half of 2004, did not appear to have significant additional"
adverse effects on the level of exports in the first half of 2005.
"Exports of machinery and equipment rose particularly strongly,"
while exports of automotive products eased. Imports also rose
"with the strength in final domestic demand, but were held back by"
a reduction in inventory investment.
Business capital spend-
ing made strong gains.
This decline in inventory investment largely reflected the
response of manufacturers and wholesalers to the drop in foreign
"demand in the second half of 2004. Business capital spending, in"
"contrast, continued to make significant gains during the first half"
"of 2005, with strong investment in structures, as well as in"
machinery and equipment. Household expenditures also rose
markedly as a result of further gains in real incomes and personal
wealth.
Data on narrow money are generally consistent with the
Bank’s current monitoring of growth in real GDP of about 3 per
cent in the third quarter of 2005 and some slowing in the fourth
quarter (Chart 5).

Estimated pressures on capacity
The economy appears to
have been operating at
its production capacity
at mid-year.
The Bank’s conventional measure of the output gap suggests
that the economy was operating at its production capacity in the
second quarter of 2005 (Chart 6 and Technical Box 1).
Statistics Canada’s measure of capacity utilization in the non-
"farm, goods-producing sector continues to indicate greater pres-"
sure on production capacity than the Bank’s conventional estimate
"of the output gap. As well, the proportion of companies reporting"
labour shortages in the Bank’s autumn Business Outlook Survey
"was well above average, while the percentage of firms reporting"
difficulties meeting an unanticipated increase in demand was also
somewhat higher than average (Chart 7). The constraints are
"strongest in the construction, commodity-producing, and trans-"
portation services sectors.
"Other indicators, however, point to less pressure on capacity."
The core rate of inflation has remained below 2 per cent since the
"end of 2003. Similarly, although some measures of wage increases"
"have picked up, overall, wage gains have continued to be moderate."
"In the July Update, the economy was seen as operating a bit"
below its capacity in mid-2005. After reviewing all the indicators
"of capacity pressures, the Governing Council now judges that the"
economy was operating at its production capacity in mid-2005.
This reflects both faster-than-expected growth in the first half of
"2005, and a judgment that the level of potential output is slightly"
lower than previously assumed.

Actual Output Growth and Conventional Estimates of Potential Output Growth
Potential output is the level of goods and services that the economy can produce
on a sustained basis without adding to inflation pressures. It is not directly observable
and must be estimated. The Bank estimates the conventional measure of potential out-
put by decomposing movements in labour productivity and labour supply into their
trend and cyclical components. The trend components of these two variables are then
combined to generate a conventional measure of potential output. Movements in var-
"iables that can be observed directly—such as the labour participation rate, population"
"growth, productivity growth, and wage and price inflation—are used to separate the"
trend and cyclical components in labour productivity and labour supply. Estimates of
potential output are constantly updated as new data and the results of ongoing
research become available.
The Bank’s conventional measure of growth in potential output has fluctuated
"over time (Chart A), having declined from about 4 per cent in 1999 to about 2.5 per"
"cent in 2002, following the downturn in the trend of labour productivity growth over"
that period.
The output gap is the difference between the levels—not the growth rates—of
actual and potential output. It is a measure of the amount of excess supply or excess
demand in the economy (see Chart 6). A large margin of uncertainty surrounds these
"conventional estimates of potential output and the output gap, and considerable care"
"must be taken in interpreting them. Because of this uncertainty, the Governing Coun-"
cil also examines a broader set of indicators when forming a judgment about capacity
pressure (see www.bankofcanada/en/rates/indinf.html).
Technical Box 2 deals with some of the factors that need to be taken into account
in projecting future labour productivity growth and future potential output.

Sectoral and regional
differences in economic
growth are becoming more
apparent as firms adjust
to shifts in relative prices.
Companies always face the challenge of adjusting to changes
in their economic environment. Strong competition from newly
"industrialized economies (particularly China), the appreciation of"
"the Canadian dollar, and rising energy prices have made the"
adjustment process even sharper than usual. The resulting large
changes in the relative prices of commodities and manufactured
goods have given rise to sectoral and regional differences in eco-
nomic growth.
Capacity constraints are most apparent in Western energy-pro-
"ducing provinces, where increases in oil and gas prices have"
raised revenues and generated gains in profits and investment.
The sudden expansion in economic activity has created labour
"shortages—not just in the energy sector, but in other sectors that"
must compete for the same pool of workers.
The situation for the manufacturing sector is somewhat differ-
ent. Since manufacturing firms export a significant portion of their
"output, the large appreciation of the Canadian dollar since 2002"
has made their goods less competitive.
Adapting to these rapid changes in their competitive position
"has been difficult for many firms. Nonetheless, evidence from the"
Bank’s surveys confirms that companies are adjusting to changing
"economic conditions. Moreover, the results of the Bank’s latest"
Business Outlook Survey suggest that investment and hiring inten-
"tions remain strong across all regions and most sectors, and that,"
"overall, companies remain positive about the outlook."
Costs
"The underlying rate of increase in wages, based on such meas-"
ures as the average hourly earnings of permanent workers and
"hourly labour compensation in the business sector, appears to"
have been in a range between 2 1/2 and 3 1/2 per cent in recent
"months (Chart 8). At the same time, the year-to-year gain in"
hourly labour compensation in the business sector picked up to
2.7 per cent in the second quarter of 2005.
Unit labour costs in the
second quarter were up 2 per
cent from year-earlier levels.
Labour productivity in the second quarter of 2005 was up only
"0.6 per cent from its year-earlier level, after two years of virtually"
no growth. With this modest increase in productivity over the past
"year, unit labour costs in the business sector in the second quarter"
of 2005 were 2 per cent higher than year-earlier levels (Chart 9).
Growth in labour produc-
tivity has been weak.
The persistence of the weakness in realized labour productiv-
ity growth is increasingly at odds with the Bank’s assumption of
"1 3/4 per cent growth in trend labour productivity, which underlies"
B A N K  O F  C A N A D A
14
our assumption of 3 per cent growth in potential output. Weak-
"ness in labour productivity growth has been broad based, showing"
"up in the manufacturing, construction, and services sectors (Techni-"
cal Box 2). While a number of sector-specific factors are contribut-
"ing to this weakness, a common factor may be that the economy"

Productivity Developments in Canada
"After growing at a robust 2.1 per cent annual rate between 1996 and 2000, labour pro-"
"ductivity in the Canadian business sector slowed in the early part of this decade, and"
"growth then averaged close to zero in 2003 and 2004. In the first half of 2005, productivity"
"has picked up slightly, growing by about 0.7 per cent on a year-over-year basis.1"
The strong growth in productivity in the latter part of the 1990s was largely associ-
ated with the manufacturing sector and the production of information and communica-
"tions technologies (ICT) equipment, as well as an increase in the capital-labour ratio"
(capital deepening). Wholesale and retail trade also posted a strong performance.
The recent productivity slump reflects a marked slowing in both capital deepening
"and efficiency gains from using capital and labour. By sector, labour productivity growth"
"initially slowed in manufacturing, followed by construction. The more pronounced slow-"
ing in business sector productivity growth in 2003 and 2004 came through the services
"sector. Weakness was widespread, but of particular note was the much lower growth in"
"finance, insurance, and real estate."
The decreased productivity in construction could result from the use of less-experi-
enced labour drawn into the sector in the face of sustained demand. Measurement issues
and difficulties in effectively integrating ICT equipment may be playing a role in the
decline in productivity within the services sector. Some of the recent weakness in produc-
tivity growth may also be a by-product of the adjustment of businesses and their workers
"to the appreciation of the Canadian dollar, higher energy prices, and new sources of com-"
"petition, particularly from newly industrialized economies in Asia (see Technical Box 1,"
April Report).
"Despite the recent poor performance in labour productivity growth, there are signs"
"that it should strengthen. First, growth in manufacturing productivity began to increase"
"in late 2004, owing to the resurgence of productivity growth in industries such as compu-"
"ter equipment, machinery, and transportation equipment. Second, investment spending"
"has risen sharply, which should lead to further capital deepening. Third, as the adjust-"
"ment process advances, and firms align their capital investments and labour inputs with"
"global developments, productivity growth can be expected to recover."
"With this in mind, the Governing Council continues to assume that trend labour pro-"
"ductivity will increase at about 1 3/4 per cent, which, combined with growth in trend"
"labour input of about 1 1/4 per cent, implies growth in potential output of 3 per cent."
"However, given that our best estimate is that potential growth has been running closer to"
2.5 per cent in the past few years (as discussed in Technical Box 1) and that it may take
"time for the economy to fully adjust to the new relative price environment, the base-case"
projection described in Section 4 of this Report assumes that growth in potential output
returns gradually to 3 per cent by 2007.
1. Analysts typically focus on productivity growth in the business sector because of problems
"in measuring productivity in the public sector. Nevertheless, over time, productivity growth"
in the total economy and in the business sector have been very similar.
B A N K  O F  C A N A D A

has
been
working
through
significant
adjustments
to
large
"changes in relative prices. Taken together, the observed weakness"
"in labour productivity, the ongoing adjustments across sectors,"
and the evidence of capacity pressures all suggest that growth in
trend labour productivity has been running below 1 3/4 per cent
in the recent period and could take some time to return to that
rate.
Commodity prices and the terms of trade
Canada’s terms of trade
continued to improve in
"the first half of 2005, but"
at a slower pace.
The year-to-year rise in Canada’s terms of trade eased substan-
"tially during the first half of 2005, as the global prices of many of"
Canada’s exports of agricultural and industrial commodities stabi-
"lized. As a result, the chain price index for GDP (a broad price"
measure of the goods and services produced in Canada) rose
2.2 per cent between the second quarter of 2004 and the second
"quarter of 2005, which was considerably less than the year-to-year"
gain over much of the preceding year (Chart 10).
Natural gas prices have
increased significantly . . .
"Crude oil prices, which were US$58 per barrel at the time of"
"the July Update, averaged US$63 per barrel in the 10 days ending"
on 14 October 2005. The large increase in crude oil prices since the
end of 2003 has resulted mainly from a substantial rise in the glo-
bal demand for energy. Natural gas prices have surged in recent
"months, moving from just under US$8 per MMBtu at the time of"
"the July Update, to about US$14 per"
MMBtu in the 10 days ending
"on 14 October, owing to hurricane-related supply disruptions in"
"U.S. production, as well as the effects of particularly hot summer"
"weather in the United States on electricity demand and, hence, on"
the demand for natural gas.
". . . while, overall, the"
prices of non-energy
commodities are largely
unchanged.
"Overall, the prices of non-energy commodities have changed"
little since mid-2005 (Chart 11). Lumber prices have eased as a
"result of increased supplies. At the same time, the impact of sev-"
eral strikes constrained supply and contributed to a further rise in
metals prices.
The substantial increases in the prices of natural gas and crude
oil since mid-2005 are expected to lead to an improvement in Can-
"ada’s terms of trade and real income, resulting in further pro-"
nounced gains in corporate profits.

3. FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
"Risk premiums are low,"
and credit growth remains
solid.
"Since the April Monetary Policy Report, financing conditions"
have
continued
to
be
"favourable,"
and
risk
premiums
have
remained low.2 Business and household credit continue to advance
at a steady pace. The Canadian dollar has appreciated against the
U.S. dollar and other major currencies over the same period.
Credit conditions
Canadian bond yields
and credit spreads have
remained low for
borrowers . . .
Business-credit conditions have remained advantageous for
"borrowers since the April Report, both in Canada and globally. In"
"financial markets, corporate bond yields and credit spreads have"
remained low for both investment-grade and non-investment-
grade borrowers (Chart 12). Narrow credit spreads reflect healthy
"corporate balance sheets, continued investor demand for higher-"
"yielding securities, and a high level of liquidity in global financial"
markets. Easy access to capital markets is indicated by the robust
growth in the gross issuance of corporate bonds.
. . . and the TSX composite
index has risen
since April.
Equity markets in the United States are broadly unchanged
"from the time of the April Report, but most other major equity"
"markets have risen, partly reflecting strong corporate profits. In"

this section reviews developments since the April Monetary Policy Report.

"Canada, the TSX composite index increased by about 9 per cent,"
led by gains in energy-sector stocks over the period.
Total business credit continued to grow at about 6 per cent per
annum (Chart 13). Growth in both short-term and long-term busi-
ness credit remains solid. One factor driving the demand for credit
has been investment to enhance efficiency. Investments aimed at
increasing capacity appear to be primarily in the energy sector.
Business and household
credit continue to grow.
"On the household side, strong consumption and activity in the"
housing market continue to be supported by rapid growth in total
household credit (Chart 13). Robust employment growth and low
"interest rates continue to keep household balance sheets healthy,"
as indicated by a historically low debt-servicing ratio and a low
delinquency rate.
Yield curves and the exchange rate
"Yields on short-term U.S. bonds have risen, while those on"
longer-term issues have moved up modestly since the April Report
(Chart 14). The increase in yields at the short end mainly reflects
"increases in the federal funds rate, which now stands at 3.75 per"
cent. U.S. federal funds futures currently imply a policy rate of
"4.25 per cent by the end of 2005, a level that is modestly higher"
than was implied by futures prices at the time of the last Report.
The low level of yields on long-term bonds in the United
States and in most industrial countries seems to be largely
explained by factors pushing up desired global savings relative to
business investment.

Canadian policy rates
remain below those in the
United States.
Canadian policy rates remain below those in the United States.
This has resulted in a wider differential between U.S. and Cana-
dian interest rates across the yield curve. Yields on two-year Cana-
dian bonds are approximately 80 basis points below those on U.S.
"Treasuries, compared with 60 points lower at the time of the April"
Report. Yield spreads on longer-term bonds have also continued to
widen.
The Canadian dollar has
recently moved into a
trading range of 84 to
86 cents U.S.
"After trading in a range of 79 to 83 cents U.S. for most of 2005,"
the Canadian dollar has been trading in a higher range of 84 to
86 cents U.S. since late summer (Chart 15). Most other major cur-
rencies have weakened against the U.S. dollar over that same
"period. As a result, the Canadian dollar has risen more sharply"
against other major currencies. The recent strength in the Cana-
"dian dollar appears to be underpinned by fundamental factors,"
including higher energy prices and Canada’s generally solid eco-
nomic performance.

4.THE OUTLOOK
The outlook begins with a base-case projection for the global
and Canadian economies and for inflation. The base case has been
developed assuming energy prices consistent with current futures
prices; a smooth and orderly resolution of global imbalances over
"the medium term, involving a modest and gradual further real"
effective depreciation of the U.S. dollar; and a relatively stable
Canada-U.S. exchange rate over the policy horizon. This is fol-
lowed by a discussion of the risks surrounding the projection.
These risks are particularly noteworthy as we look to 2007 and
"beyond, given the uncertainties related to the manner in which"
global imbalances will be unwound.
International background
"In the Bank’s base-case projection, the profile for crude oil and"
natural gas prices is based on current futures prices. This implies
that the price for crude oil will be just below US$65 per barrel
through 2006 and 2007. Natural gas prices are assumed to remain
at or above US$10 per MMBtu through 2007Q1 before falling below
US$10 per MMBtu through the rest of 2007 (Chart 16). These higher
energy prices are expected to have a small restraining effect on
both aggregate supply and demand in the global economy.
Real prices for non-energy commodities are assumed to remain
"near current levels through 2006 and 2007, since supply is"
expected to expand roughly in line with demand.

The base-case outlook for GDP growth in the United States and
in the major overseas economies suggests that the global economy
will continue to expand at about 4 per cent per year over the pro-
jection horizon (Table 1).
Economic growth is
expected to remain strong
in Asia . . .
"Economic growth in Asia is expected to remain robust, despite"
higher energy prices. China and the other Asian newly industrial-
"ized economies continue to expand rapidly, and will continue to"
"do so over the next few years. As well, the economic expansion in"
Japan appears to be building momentum. The rate of inflation in
Japan is expected to turn positive by the end of 2006.
. . . but has been weaker
than expected in the
euro area.
"In contrast, growth in euro zone economies remains sluggish"
"and is expected to average 1.2 per cent in 2005, a somewhat"
weaker performance than anticipated at the time of the last Report.
Economic activity in the euro zone has not been as strong as
"expected, partly reflecting uncertainty concerning labour market"
"and other structural reforms, as well as higher energy prices. GDP"
growth in the euro zone is projected to pick up gradually over the
next two years as domestic demand recovers.
Data on the U.S. economy suggest that growth has been rela-
tively strong. Real U.S. GDP expanded at an annual rate of 3.3 per
cent in the second quarter of 2005. Monthly indicators support a
"further pickup in activity in the third quarter, led by particularly"
robust housing activity and consumer spending. The effects of
"Hurricane Katrina and higher energy prices will, however, have a"
dampening impact on the U.S. economy for the remainder of this
year.
U.S. GDP growth is
expected to remain solid
in 2006 and 2007.
"Accordingly, U.S. GDP is expected to grow by 3.5 per cent in"
"2005, somewhat less than the 3.7 per cent anticipated at the time"
of the July Update. Economic activity is expected to pick up
"slightly in 2006, as the adverse effects of higher energy prices are"
more than fully offset by increased construction associated with
"the cleanup and rebuilding of storm-damaged areas.3 In 2007, the"
"U.S. economy is expected to slow modestly, as domestic demand"
"retreats, owing to increases in U.S. policy rates and increased"
household and government savings.
This base-case projection assumes that global imbalances will
"be resolved over an extended period, with relatively modest year-"
"to-year movements. Thus, the U.S. current account deficit, which"
"is largely matched by surpluses in Asia and in oil-exporting countries,"
3. Overall growth in U.S. real GDP in 2005 is expected to be reduced by 0.1 per
cent at annual rates as a result of the economic disruption caused by Hurri-
"cane Katrina. In 2006, real GDP growth is projected to be 0.1 per cent higher,"
"owing to the reconstruction effort, but growth could be slightly stronger,"
depending on the extent of the reconstruction funded by the federal govern-
ment.

starts to gradually unwind in 2007. This unwinding involves
"increased domestic demand in Asia, Europe, and oil-exporting"
countries in 2007; an increase in private and public savings in the
United States; and a further real effective depreciation of the U.S.
"dollar, which shifts demand towards U.S. exports and reduces the"
U.S. demand for foreign imports.
Aggregate demand and supply in Canada
Solid growth in final
domestic demand is
expected to support
economic expansion in
Canada through 2007.
"In the base-case projection for Canada, solid growth in final"
domestic demand is expected to continue to contribute impor-
tantly to economic expansion in the second half of 2005 and
through 2006 and 2007.
Several factors point to further strong increases in business
investment. These include an expanding global economy and indi-
cations that energy and non-energy commodity prices will remain
"high for some time, the high rate of capacity utilization in a"
number
of
capital-intensive
"industries,"
continued
favourable
"financial conditions, strong profit levels and balance sheets, and"
earlier reductions in the prices of imported machinery and equip-
ment.
A solid pace of growth in
consumer expenditures is
projected in 2006 and
2007 . . .
"After a substantial advance in 2005, consumer spending is"
"expected to rise solidly through 2006 and 2007, albeit at a more"
modest pace than in 2005 and somewhat less than projected in the
July Update (Table 2). Higher energy prices will tend to dampen

"consumption growth (Technical Box 3), as will the slightly lower"
income growth from the lower assumed profile for potential out-
"put. Nonetheless, still-robust gains in real incomes and relatively"
low long-term interest rates should help support the pace of con-
"sumer spending in 2006 and 2007. Consumer confidence, which"
recently fell in the immediate wake of hurricanes in the United
"States, is expected to recover. Housing investment is expected to"
"be little changed, on balance, following strong increases in recent"
years.
The base-case outlook continues to incorporate an assumption
of relatively strong growth in total spending on goods and serv-
"ices by all levels of government combined, with overall spending"
"on goods, services, and transfers rising at about the same rate as"
revenues.

tion that the Canadian dollar continues to trade in its recent range
"of 84 to 86 cents U.S., there will be further effects on trade. While"
there is considerable uncertainty regarding the speed and magni-
"tude of the effects of exchange rate movements on net exports, on"
"balance, net exports are expected to exert a small drag on overall"
growth through 2006 and 2007. This is a somewhat weaker track

Technical Box 3
The Economic Effects of Higher Energy Prices for Canada
Fluctuations in the global prices of energy commodities affect economic activity through
"various channels (Stuber 2001). As a net exporter of oil, petroleum products, and natural gas,"
"Canada would see its terms of trade, and therefore its real income, increase as energy prices"
"rise. But since most of Canada’s important trading partners are net importers of energy, higher"
energy prices could be expected to reduce their demand for Canada’s exports. Energy-price
increases would also raise the operating costs of Canadian businesses and reduce the real
"incomes of households, while transferring income to oil and gas producers."
Energy-price movements importantly affect the composition of aggregate demand in
Canada and have differing sectoral and regional effects.
A sustained increase in the price of West Texas Intermediate crude oil of US$10 per bar-
rel could directly raise Canada’s real income by close to 0.3 per cent. It is estimated that
"aggregate activity in Canada could edge up by about 0.1 per cent after three years, as capital"
spending by oil and gas companies and spending by governments gradually increase (Table
"A).1,2 On the other hand, exports, consumer spending, and investment by non-energy firms"
"would likely be somewhat lower. In the short run, aggregate activity would likely be lower"
"by about 0.1 per cent, as decision, planning, and regulatory lags, together with tight markets"
"for many inputs (including labour), would probably limit the initial response of the energy"
sector to increased revenues.
A sustained 20 per cent rise in the U.S.-dollar price of natural gas is estimated to raise
aggregate activity in Canada by a somewhat larger amount after three years—about 0.2 per
cent. The adverse effects of higher natural gas prices on U.S. demand for Canadian products
"would be expected to be considerably smaller than those of a similar oil-price increase, since"
the United States is much less dependent on natural gas imports than on foreign supplies of
crude oil and petroleum products.
1.
The estimates shown in Table A are based on an extension of the analysis undertaken in Stu-
"ber (2001). First, the effects of an oil-price increase on the incomes of energy and non-energy"
"businesses, households, and the government sector are assessed, along with their impact on for-"
"eign demand for Canadian products. These effects, together with assumptions for the marginal"
"propensities to spend and to import, are then used to estimate the effect of the oil-price increase"
on the various components of GDP.
2.
"Factors that have limited the actual increase in the profits of oil and gas companies over the past year,"
"as the prices of energy commodities rose, have included the further appreciation of the Canadian dollar,"
"oil-price hedging programs, and weakness in the price of heavy crude oil relative to that of light crude."

*It is assumed that the increased government revenues stemming from higher oil prices are either saved
or spent on goods and services. Part of these higher revenues might instead be returned to households
in the form of either increased transfer payments or reduced taxes. The estimated impact on consump-
"tion would then be less negative than shown in Table A, while the impact on government spending"
would be less positive. The overall effect on economic activity should be largely unchanged.

"for net exports in 2006 than that in the July Update, owing largely"
to the stronger Canadian dollar.4
Canada’s GDP is
"projected to grow, on"
"average, by about"
"2.8 per cent in 2005,"
"2.9 per cent in 2006, and"
3 per cent in 2007 . . .
The Bank’s base-case projection therefore calls for economic
"growth, on an average annual basis, to be 2.8 per cent in 2005 ris-"
ing gradually to 2.9 per cent in 2006 and to 3.0 per cent in 2007.
This is in line with the latest Consensus Economics outlook. The
outlook for growth is a little higher in 2005 and a little lower in
"2006 than at the time of the July Update, reflecting the elimination"
of the output gap and a modest reduction in the assumed growth
rate of potential output through 2005 and 2006.5
. . . with the economy
operating at its produc-
tion capacity over the
projection horizon.
"On a quarterly basis, the Bank projects that real GDP growth"
will edge down to about 3.0 and 2.7 per cent in the third and
"fourth quarters of 2005, respectively. It will then increase modestly"
to close to 3 per cent over the four quarters of 2006 and through
"2007 (Chart 17, Table 3). This base-case projection incorporates"
some further reduction in monetary stimulus to maintain a bal-
ance between aggregate supply and demand in the Canadian
economy and thus keep inflation on target. The economy contin-
ues to operate at about its production capacity throughout the
projection horizon.
4. Somewhat weaker growth in U.S. GDP resulting from Hurricane Katrina is
expected to dampen Canadian net exports in the third and fourth quarters of
"2005, but the effect will be muted, since half of the negative impact in the"
"United States will be in the three affected states that, together, account for only"
about 1 per cent of total Canadian exports.
"5. As discussed in Technical Box 2, while we have retained the assumption"
"that potential output will grow at 3 per cent for 2007, it is assumed to grow at"
"2.8 per cent in 2005 and 2.9 per cent in 2006, reﬂecting recent low productivity"
growth and the signiﬁcant amount of adjustment taking place in the Canadian
economy in response to large relative price changes.

The base-case projection for inflation
While indicators of
near-term inflation
expectations have
"edged up, longer-term"
measures remain well
anchored to 2 per cent.
Although most indicators of near-term inflation expectations
"that the Bank follows have edged up in recent months, key"
medium- and longer-term measures remain well anchored to the
2 per cent target. While 70 per cent of firms in the Bank’s autumn
Business Outlook Survey expect CPI inflation to be within a range of
"1 to 3 per cent, on average, over the next two years, the percentage"
of respondents expecting inflation to be above 3 per cent rose
"appreciably from the preceding survey. Nevertheless, the average"
private sector forecast for total CPI inflation over the longer term is
near 2 per cent (Consensus Economics Inc. 2005).
Total CPI inflation is
projected to average close
to 3 per cent for the rest of
2005 and for the first half
"of 2006, before returning"
to the 2 per cent target in
the second half of 2006.
Total CPI inflation is projected to average near to 3 per cent for
"the rest of 2005 and for the first half of 2006, before returning to"
the 2 per cent target in the second half of 2006. For the next year
"or so, total CPI will continue to be importantly affected by recent"
"developments in the market for crude oil, natural gas, gasoline,"
"and heating oil (Chart 16). While gasoline prices, on a month-to-"
"month basis, are expected to ease somewhat through to early 2006,"
consumer prices for natural gas are projected to increase consider-
"ably over the same period, as recent increases in wholesale prices"
become reflected in regulated prices and contracts.
Core inflation is expected
to average about 1.6 per
cent over the remainder
of 2005 . . .
Core inflation is projected to continue to average close to
1.6 per cent through to the end of 2005. The past appreciation of
"the Canadian dollar, together with expected ongoing reductions in"
the world prices of some consumer goods (owing to increasing
supplies from countries such as China) and some temporary
"effects related to automobile prices, are exerting some downward"
pressure on inflation.
. . . before returning to 2
per cent by mid-2006.
With the economy expected to be operating at production
"capacity and inflation expectations well anchored, total CPI infla-"
tion should decrease to the 2 per cent target in the second half of
2006. The core rate is projected to rise to 2 per cent by mid-2006
"and to remain there through 2007 (Table 3), owing to these same"
factors. This assumes that there is little pass-through from higher
oil and natural gas prices and the recent appreciation of the Cana-
"dian dollar into core inflation, consistent with experience in recent"
years.
Increases in average hourly earnings of permanent workers are
"expected to rise over the projection period. At the same time, how-"
"ever, with a significant improvement in the growth of labour pro-"
"ductivity, the projected year-to-year increase in unit labour costs"
"over this period, should remain around 2 per cent."

Risks to the base-case projection
The base-case projection incorporates a number of assump-
tions: global energy prices evolve in line with current futures
prices; productivity growth in Canada continues to recover; there
is little feed-through from higher oil and gas prices into core infla-
tion; there is a gradual unwinding of global imbalances; and the
Canadian dollar continues to trade in its recent range relative to
the U.S. dollar. Clearly there are risks and uncertainties around
each of these assumptions.
"Over the next four to six quarters, risks to the base-case projec-"
tion for Canada appear to be balanced. There are both upside and
"downside risks to global economic activity, stemming primarily"
from future energy prices and the pace of growth in China. For
"Canada, these global risks could affect the evolution of net"
"exports, commodity prices, and the exchange rate."
"Adjustment to the appreciation of the Canadian dollar, higher"
"commodity prices, and increased competition from China and"
other newly industrialized economies is so far proceeding in line
"with expectations. However, there are still both upside and down-"
side risks to exports and imports as this continuing adjustment
unfolds.
The ongoing adjustment and large relative price changes also
pose some risks to the outlook for inflation. While the balance of
indicators suggests that the economy is operating at its production

"potential, sectoral and regional shifts occurring in the Canadian"
economy make the overall assessment of capacity pressures partic-
ularly complex. With the economy operating at its production
"potential, there is also the risk that higher energy costs could feed"
through more broadly to the prices of non-energy goods and serv-
"ices, increasing the upward pressure on inflation. The risk of this"
"affecting longer-term inflation expectations should be mitigated,"
"however, by monetary policy clearly focused on achieving the"
2 per cent target.
"Looking to 2007 and beyond, there are risks related to the man-"
ner in which global imbalances will be unwound. The imbalances
"remain sizable, and the longer they persist without appropriate"
"policy actions being taken, the higher is the risk that their resolu-"
tion could involve a period of weakness in worldwide aggregate
demand.
"The principal risk is that, as the savings rates of households"
"and governments begin to rise in the United States, domestic"
demand elsewhere in the world fails to pick up sufficiently to sus-
tain global demand. Uncertainty related to structural reform appears
to have resulted in increased precautionary savings in significant
"parts of Europe, while in China the need to self-insure against"
health risks and to provide for education costs is leading house-
holds to save a very large proportion of their income gains. More
"recently, higher oil prices are shifting current account surpluses"
towards
oil-exporting
"countries,"
which
may
dampen
global
demand if these increased oil revenues do not translate suffi-
ciently into increased import demand by these countries. For the
"base-case projection to be realized, U.S. consumers and governments"
"need to spend less and save more, and policy actions need to be"
taken elsewhere to encourage stronger domestic demand.
There is also the risk of an abrupt and disorderly adjustment.
This would likely involve large movements in exchange rates and
other asset prices and a sharp slowing in the world economy. The
economic cost for the world economy would be greater if some
countries resist fundamental exchange rate movements or if there
is a rise in protectionism.
"For Canada, the risks of weaker global demand beginning"
some time in 2007 would imply less demand for Canadian prod-
"ucts, less buoyancy in commodity prices and, hence, less growth"
in business investment. A sharp depreciation of the U.S. dollar
"against the Canadian dollar, as part of a broader currency adjust-"
"ment, would further exacerbate the negative impact on the"
demand for Canadian-produced goods. Such weaker demand
would have implications for the conduct of monetary policy.
