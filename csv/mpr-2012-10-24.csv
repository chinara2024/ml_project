Canada’s Inﬂ
ation-Control Strategy1
Infl
ation targeting and the economy
• The Bank’s mandate is to conduct monetary policy to pro-
mote the economic and fi
nancial well-being of Canadians .
• Canada’s experience with infl
ation targeting since 1991
has shown that the best way to foster confi
dence in the
value of money and to contribute to sustained economic
"growth, employment gains and improved living standards"
is by keeping infl
"ation low, stable and predictable ."
"• In 2011, the Government and the Bank of Canada renewed"
Canada’s infl
ation-control target for a further fi
ve-year
"period, ending 31 December 2016 . The target, as measured"
"by the total consumer price index (CPI), remains at the"
2 per cent midpoint of the control range of 1 to 3 per cent .
The monetary policy instrument
• The Bank carries out monetary policy through changes
in the target overnight rate of interest .2 These changes
are transmitted to the economy through their infl
uence
"on market interest rates, domestic asset prices and the"
"exchange rate, which aff"
ect total demand for Canadian
goods and services . The balance between this demand
"and the economy’s production capacity is, over time, the"
primary determinant of infl
ation pressures in the economy .
• Monetary policy actions take time—usually from six to
eight quarters—to work their way through the economy
and have their full eff
ect on infl
"ation . For this reason,"
monetary policy must be forward looking .
"• Consistent with its commitment to clear, transparent"
"communications, the Bank regularly reports its perspec-"
tive on the forces at work on the economy and their
implications for infl
ation . The Monetary Policy Report is a
key element of this approach . Policy decisions are typi-
"cally announced on eight pre-set days during the year,"
"and full updates of the Bank’s outlook, including risks to"
"the projection, are published four times per year in the"
Monetary Policy Report .
Infl
ation targeting is symmetric and ﬂ
exible
• Canada’s infl
"ation-targeting approach is symmetric, which"
means that the Bank is equally concerned about infl
ation
rising above or falling below the 2 per cent target .
• Canada’s infl
ation-targeting framework is ﬂ
exible .
"Typically, the Bank seeks to return infl"
ation to target over
"a horizon of six to eight quarters . However, the most"
appropriate horizon for returning infl
ation to target will
vary depending on the nature and persistence of the
shocks buff
eting the economy .
Monitoring infl
ation
"• In the short run, a good deal of movement in the CPI is"
caused by fl
uctuations in the prices of certain volatile
"components (e .g ., fruit and gasoline) and by changes in"
"indirect taxes . For this reason, the Bank also monitors a"
set of “core” infl
"ation measures, most importantly the"
"CPIX, which strips out eight of the most volatile CPI com-"
ponents and the eff
ect of indirect taxes on the remaining
components . These “core” measures allow the Bank to
“look through” temporary price movements and focus on
the underlying trend of infl
"ation . In this sense, core infl"
a-
tion is monitored as an operational guide to help the Bank
achieve the total CPI infl
ation target . It is not a replace-
ment for it .
1 See Joint Statement of the Government of Canada and the Bank of Canada on the Renewal of the Inﬂ
ation-Control Target (8 November 2011) and
Renewal of the Inﬂ
"ation-Control Target: Background Information—November 2011, which are both available on the Bank’s website ."
"2 When interest rates are at the zero lower bound, additional monetary easing to achieve the infl"
ation target can be provided through three unconven-
tional instruments: (i) a conditional statement on the future path of the policy rate; (ii) quantitative easing; and (iii) credit easing . These instruments
and the principles guiding their use are described in the Annex to the April 2009 Monetary Policy Report .
Monetary Policy Report
October 2012
This is a report of the Governing Council of the Bank of Canada:
"Mark Carney, Tiff Macklem, John Murray, Timothy Lane, Jean Boivin and Agathe Côté."
This report includes data received up to 19 October 2012.
"“While Canada’s economy is being affected by the global angst,"
the key areas of uncertainty abroad are all points of justifiable
confidence here at home. Canada’s public finances are sound.
Monetary policy is clear and credible. Canada’s financial system
showed itself to be among the most resilient in the world
"through the crisis. Since then, it has strengthened further.”"

Overview
The global economy has unfolded broadly as the Bank projected in July.
The economic expansion in the United States is progressing at a gradual
pace. Europe is in recession and recent indicators point to a continued
"contraction. In China and other major emerging economies, growth has"
"slowed somewhat more than expected, though there are signs of stabiliza-"
tion around current growth rates. Notwithstanding the slowdown in global
"economic activity, prices for oil and other commodities produced in Canada"
"have, on average, increased in recent months. Global financial conditions"
"have improved, supported by aggressive policy actions of major central"
"banks, but sentiment remains fragile."
"In Canada, while global headwinds continue to restrain economic activity,"
domestic factors are supporting a moderate expansion. Following the recent
"period of below-potential growth, the economy is expected to pick up and"
return to full capacity by the end of 2013. The Bank continues to project that
the expansion will be driven mainly by growth in consumption and busi-
"ness investment, reflecting very stimulative domestic financial conditions."
"Housing activity is expected to decline from historically high levels, while"
the household debt burden is expected to rise further before stabilizing by
the end of the projection horizon. Canadian exports are projected to pick
up gradually but remain below their pre-recession peak until the first half of
"2014, reflecting weak foreign demand and ongoing competitiveness chal-"
lenges. These challenges include the persistent strength of the Canadian
"dollar, which is being influenced by safe-haven flows and spillovers from"
global monetary policy.
"After taking into account revisions to the National Accounts, the Bank pro-"
"jects that the economy will grow by 2.2 per cent in 2012, 2.3 per cent in 2013"
and 2.4 per cent in 2014.
"Core inflation has been lower than expected in recent months, reflecting"
somewhat softer prices across a wide range of goods and services. Core
"inflation is expected to increase gradually over coming quarters, reaching"
2 per cent by the middle of 2013 as the economy gradually absorbs the
"current small degree of slack, the growth of labour compensation remains"
moderate and inflation expectations stay well anchored. Total CPI inflation
"has fallen noticeably below the 2 per cent target, as expected, and is pro-"
"jected to return to target by the end of 2013, somewhat later than previously"
anticipated.

Bank of Canada  •  Monetary Policy Report  •  October 2012
The inflation outlook in Canada is subject to significant risks. The Bank’s
projection assumes that authorities in Europe are able to contain the
"ongoing crisis, and that the U.S. fiscal cliff will be avoided. Imbalances in"
the Canadian household sector remain the biggest domestic risk. This risk is
two-sided.
The three main upside risks to inflation in Canada relate to the possibility
"of higher global inflationary pressures, stronger Canadian exports and"
renewed momentum in Canadian residential investment.
The three main downside risks to inflation in Canada relate to the European
"crisis, weaker demand for Canadian exports and the possibility that growth"
in Canadian household spending could be weaker.
"Overall, the Bank judges that the risks to the inflation outlook in Canada are"
roughly balanced over the projection period.
"Reflecting all of these factors, on 23 October, the Bank decided to maintain"
"the target for the overnight rate at 1 per cent. Over time, some modest with-"
"drawal of monetary policy stimulus will likely be required, consistent with"
achieving the 2 per cent inflation target. The timing and degree of any such
withdrawal will be weighed carefully against global and domestic develop-
"ments, including the evolution of imbalances in the household sector."

Global Economy
The global economy has unfolded broadly as the Bank projected in its July
Monetary Policy Report. While the economic expansion in the United States
"is progressing at a gradual pace, Europe is in recession, and recent indica-"
tors point to continued contraction. In China and other major emerging
"economies, growth has slowed somewhat more than expected, though"
there are signs of stabilization around current growth rates. Notwithstanding
"the slowdown in global economic activity, prices for oil and other commod-"
"ities produced by Canada have increased, on average, in recent months."
"Global financial conditions have improved since the last Report, supported"
"by the aggressive policy actions of major central banks, particularly the U.S."
"Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank (ECB) and the Bank of Japan"
"(Chart 1 and Chart 2). Overall sentiment, however, remains fragile."
"Following 3.8 per cent growth in 2011, global economic growth is expected"
"to slow to 3.0 per cent in 2012 and 3.1 per cent in 2013, before rising to"
3.5 per cent in 2014 (Table 1). The Bank’s base-case scenario continues to
be predicated on the following two important assumptions: the crisis in the
"euro area will remain contained, and a severe tightening of U.S. fiscal policy"
"at the beginning of 2013, the so-called “fiscal cliff,” will be avoided. The"
Bank’s projections incorporate the impact on the global economy of these
and other sources of uncertainty.
Underlying global inflationary pressures are expected to ease over the
"projection horizon, given the considerable excess capacity observed in"
many advanced economies. The recent increase in energy and food prices
"will, however, provide a short-term offset, particularly in emerging-market"
economies (EMEs).

Global Financial Conditions
"Global financial conditions have improved modestly since the last Report,"
supported by several significant central bank initiatives and reduced concerns
about a serious near-term credit event. Tail risks in the euro area are per-
ceived to have diminished significantly following the ECB’s announcement of
"its Outright Monetary Transactions (OMT) program, while the announcement"
by the U.S. Federal Reserve of substantial additional monetary easing has
provided further support for some risky assets (Box 1).1
The more positive market tone has been reflected in narrower credit
"spreads, strong corporate issuance (Chart 3) and large gains in many equity"
markets. The extraordinary liquidity provided by central banks may also be
pushing down measures of financial market volatility.
"The OMT program, which allows the ECB to purchase government bonds in"
"the secondary market, is designed to eliminate the risk of euro redenomina-"
tion and improve the monetary policy transmission mechanism in the euro
"area.2 This action, coupled with other encouraging policy developments in the"
"euro area, has lowered the probability of a severe crisis and has led to a"
"reversal of some safe-haven flows.3 As a result, sovereign yields in several"
peripheral euro-area countries have declined substantially (Chart 4). Bond
"yields in peripheral euro-area countries nevertheless continue to be elevated,"
"and significant financial market strains remain. Notably, there are signs of"
"increasing fragmentation of European financial markets, with reduced cross-"
border financial activity and an evident home bias in investment portfolios.
1	 The increase observed in risk appetite was also reinforced by the announcement of additional mon-
"etary accommodation by other central banks, including the Bank of Japan, which expanded the size of"
its Asset Purchase Program by about 10 trillion yen in mid-September.
2	 The ECB has indicated that Outright Monetary Transactions will be considered only if they are war-
"ranted from a monetary policy perspective, and as long as the conditions established under the"
European Financial Stability Facility / European Stability Mechanism (ESM) program are fully respected.
3	 This improvement in risk sentiment was further reinforced by other developments being interpreted as
"euro-area friendly, such as the Dutch elections and the decision of the German constitutional court that"
"cleared the way for ratification of the ESM treaty, which was inaugurated in early October."

"Short-term yields in some core European countries are near zero, signalling"
that investors are still wary and are willing to pay a premium to protect their
"investments (Chart 5). In addition, the most recent bank lending survey in the"
"euro area suggests that, in the second quarter, banks continued to tighten"
credit standards on loans to enterprises and that they expected to tighten
standards further in the third quarter for all categories of loans.
Box 1
The Implications of Recent U.S. Monetary Policy Developments
Following the 12–13 September meeting of the Federal
"Open Market Committee (FOMC), the U.S. Federal Reserve"
announced that it would purchase additional agency
mortgage-backed securities at a pace of US$40 billion per
month. The Committee also stated that it would continue
its purchases of mortgage-backed securities and undertake
"additional asset purchases, as appropriate, until substantial"
improvement in the outlook for the labour market has been
"achieved. In addition, the Committee extended its forward"
guidance for exceptionally low levels of the federal funds
"rate through at least mid-2015, and added that it expects a"
highly accommodative stance of monetary policy to remain
appropriate “for a considerable time after the economic
"recovery strengthens.” Together, these actions have been"
dubbed “QE3.”
These policy measures are more aggressive than previously
"anticipated, thereby contributing to stronger growth over"
"the projection horizon. In particular, the Bank expects these"
measures to support U.S. economic activity by:
"•	 lowering mortgage rates, which will encourage home"
purchases and refinancing;
•	 encouraging investors to rebalance their portfolios
"toward riskier higher-return assets, thus:"
-
-
creating positive wealth effects through higher asset
"prices, which will support consumption;"
-
-
stimulating consumption and investment by reducing
the cost of borrowing; and
•	 exerting downward pressure on the foreign exchange
"value of the U.S. dollar, thereby stimulating U.S. exports"
and reducing imports.
There is uncertainty regarding the magnitude of the impact
of QE3 on U.S. financial conditions and economic activity.
Estimates of the impact of earlier rounds of “QE” span a
"fairly wide range. Moreover, it is difficult to apply the ear-"
lier estimates to QE3 because (i) the macroeconomic and
financial environment has changed; and (ii) unlike previous
"rounds, the Federal Reserve did not announce a predeter-"
mined quantity or time horizon for purchases under QE3.
U.S. financial conditions have eased since the release of the
"minutes of the 31 July–1 August FOMC meeting, where the"
possibility of taking additional policy actions was widely
discussed (Table 1-A). Corporate credit spreads and bor-
"rowing rates have declined, equity prices have risen, and the"
"U.S. dollar has also weakened. Moreover, issuance of invest-"
ment-grade and high-yield corporate debt has proceeded
"at a near-record pace. It must be noted, however, that since"
"many factors affect financial markets simultaneously, it is"
difficult to isolate the impact of the additional easing.
The Bank estimates that QE3 will lift the level of U.S. GDP
"by 1.3 per cent by 2014 and, more broadly, boost global"
"economic activity, increasing the demand for Canadian"
exports and supporting commodity prices. Lower yields for
a variety of U.S. asset classes mean that similar Canadian
financial assets will now offer relatively higher returns. As a
"consequence, some substitution into Canadian assets can"
"be expected, which would lower Canadian yields and put"
upward pressure on the value of the Canadian dollar.
"On balance, QE3 is estimated to be modestly positive for"
"the Canadian economy, lifting the level of real GDP by"
"about 0.4 per cent by 2014. However, the precise impact"
will depend importantly on the extent to which the various
channels of influence operate.

"In the United States, the Federal Reserve has extended its forward guidance for"
exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate through to at least mid-2015.
"Moreover, in addition to completing the maturity extension program, the Federal"
Reserve will provide further policy accommodation by purchasing additional
agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) at a pace of US$40 billion per month.
The Fed has indicated that it will continue this MBS purchase program (or under-
take additional asset purchases) until there is a substantial improvement in the
outlook for the U.S. labour market in a context of price stability (Box 1).
"U.S. credit spreads have continued to narrow recently, with the yields on both"
investment-grade and high-yield corporate bonds declining to near-record
"levels, supported by robust investor demand. Spreads in the MBS market have"
also tightened substantially following the Federal Reserve announcement.

Euro Area
The euro area is in recession. GDP contracted by 0.7 per cent in the second
"quarter of 2012, a slightly smaller decline than anticipated in the July Report."
"However, economic indicators suggest that the strained economic situation"
in peripheral economies continues to spread to the core countries. The
euro-area composite Economic Sentiment Indicator (ESI) and the composite
"Purchasing Managers’ Indexes both fell to near 3-year lows, and the ESIs for"
France and Germany have continued to slide (Chart 6).

Bank of Canada  •  Monetary Policy Report  •  October 2012
"Euro-area activity is projected to contract further in the second half of 2012,"
and GDP is expected to decline by 0.5 per cent for the year as a whole. With
"ongoing bank deleveraging, fiscal austerity measures, tensions in financial"
markets and low confidence continuing to weigh on the outlook for the euro
"area, the Bank expects very modest growth of 0.4 and 1.0 per cent in"
"2013 and 2014, respectively. Domestic demand in the euro area is anticipated"
"to remain extremely weak, with some offsetting support for economic activity"
"provided by export growth. However, the level of euro-area GDP is projected"
to stay below its 2008 peak throughout the 2012–14 period (Chart 7).
"Headline inflation in the euro area remained at 2.6 per cent in September,"
supported by increases in indirect taxes and administered prices in peripheral
"countries, as well as the recent run-up in energy prices. Inflation is expected"
to remain above 2 per cent throughout 2012 and to decline gradually to below
2 per cent over the projection horizon.
While the introduction of the OMT by the ECB provides time for reforms to
"be implemented, further substantive measures will be needed to continue to"
contain the crisis and put euro-area economies on a sustainable path. Fiscal
"and structural policy adjustments will take several more years to complete,"
and market confidence will be restored only gradually.
United States
"The U.S. economic expansion is continuing at a gradual pace, consistent"
with the experience of other advanced countries that have undergone
severe financial crises (Chart 8). GDP growth in 2012 is projected to be
"slightly higher than previously anticipated, owing to historical revisions for"
late 2011 that affect annual average growth for 2012 and more than offset
the negative effects of the severe drought on farm output. Fiscal consolida-

Bank of Canada  •  Monetary Policy Report  •  October 2012
"nevertheless continue to restrain growth. In 2013, growth is projected to"
"accelerate, supported by a pickup in external demand, a gradual improve-"
ment in labour market conditions and the recent announcement of addi-
tional policy easing by the Federal Reserve.
"Relative to the July Report, U.S. GDP growth in 2013 and 2014 has been"
"revised up to 2.3 per cent and 3.2 per cent, respectively, owing to a larger"
policy response by the Federal Reserve than was previously expected. These
policy measures will support stronger growth over the projection horizon by
"lowering the cost of credit to consumers and businesses, boosting asset"
"prices and wealth, and putting downward pressure on the U.S. dollar (Box 1),"
thus contributing to higher growth in consumption and both residential and
non-residential investment than had been anticipated in July.
The Bank’s base-case scenario assumes that the drag from fiscal consoli-
dation will amount to roughly 1 percentage point in 2012 and 1.5 percentage
"points in both 2013 and 2014 (Chart 9). However, a severe tightening of fiscal"
"policy at the beginning of 2013 is built into current legislation, which, if fully"
"implemented, could reduce U.S. real GDP growth next year by approxi-"
mately 4 percentage points. The outlook is therefore highly uncertain and is
contingent on political willingness to address the impending fiscal cliff.
"There are signs that the uncertainty around the fiscal outlook, coupled with"
the fragile state of the European economy and other worrying external
"developments, has already begun to affect U.S. economic activity, with"
firms deciding to delay spending on some investment projects (Chart 10).
Consumption expenditures are expected to grow at a relatively slow but
steady pace over the projection horizon. Weak labour market conditions
"continue to restrain household income, with the level of employment still"
4.5 million below its previous peak (Chart 11). While the unemployment rate
"has declined in recent months, partly reflecting a further drop in labour force"
"participation, it remains elevated. On the positive side, household net worth"
U.S. GDP growth has been
"revised up in 2013 and 2014,"
owing to a larger policy response
by the Federal Reserve

"is gradually being rebuilt, supported by gains in both equity and house"
"prices. In addition, the household debt-to-income ratio has returned to 2005"
levels and the debt-service ratio has reached multi-year lows.
"Residential investment has rebounded in recent quarters, albeit from a very"
depressed level. Although home-builder sentiment has improved signifi-
"cantly and the number of building permits has climbed above 800,000 for"
"the first time since 2008 (Chart 12), housing demand remains subdued. The"
"significant overhang of unoccupied dwellings, as well as homes in the fore-"
"closure pipeline, continues to restrain new construction and limit upward"
pressure on prices. The Bank expects that a gradual easing in lending con-
"ditions, improving labour market conditions and underlying demographic"
demand will support the recovery in residential construction over the projec-
tion horizon. The announcement by the U.S. Federal Reserve that it will
purchase mortgage-backed securities will also help in this regard.

Bank of Canada  •  Monetary Policy Report  •  October 2012
The recovery in non-residential construction is expected to proceed at a
"modest pace, restrained by elevated vacancy rates and tight borrowing"
conditions. Growth in investment in equipment and software decelerated
markedly in the first two quarters of 2012 and is projected to remain rela-
"tively weak in the short term, constrained in part by the uncertainty associ-"
ated with the global economic outlook and the impending fiscal cliff. As
"these negative effects gradually dissipate and GDP growth picks up, growth"
"in business investment is expected to rebound, supported by healthy cor-"
porate balance sheets. This rebound is slightly stronger than forecast in the
"July Report, owing to the additional monetary stimulus."
U.S. export growth in 2012 has been affected by slowing external demand
"and the past appreciation of the U.S. real effective exchange rate, but is pro-"
jected to strengthen gradually starting in the second half of 2013 as global
demand growth begins to recover.
Excess supply in the U.S. economy is expected to remain significant until
"well beyond 2014, dampening underlying inflationary pressures. Consumer"
"price inflation will increase in the short term, however, reflecting the rapid"
increase in gasoline prices in recent months and the impact of the rise in
food prices associated with the drought that affected vast areas of U.S.
farmland. The additional policy easing by the Federal Reserve will also pro-
vide somewhat more support to inflation than previously anticipated.
Japan
Real GDP growth in Japan decelerated to 0.7 per cent in the second quarter of
2012 from 5.3 per cent in the first quarter. The sharp slowdown was in line with
expectations at the time of the July Report and reflected a broad-based slow-
"down in domestic demand, as well as continued weakness in external demand,"

especially from Europe and China. The contribution from public investment was
"also lower in the second quarter; growth in this sector remained strong, how-"
"ever, owing to reconstruction efforts following the natural disasters of March"
2011. Consumer price inflation in Japan remains slightly below zero.
Japan’s real GDP growth is projected to average only about 1 per cent in
"2013 and 2014. A strong yen, together with weak growth in foreign demand,"
"is anticipated to weigh on the pace of economic activity in the short term,"
while a planned increase in the value-added tax on consumption and
declining reconstruction-related spending are expected to dampen growth
toward the end of the projection horizon.4
Emerging-Market Economies
Real GDP growth in China slowed further in the third quarter of 2012
"to 7.4 per cent on a year-over-year basis. The ongoing slowdown, also"
"reflected in weak industrial production data, is the result of continuing"
"efforts by Chinese authorities to rein in an overheated property market, as"
"well as reduced external demand, particularly from Europe (Chart 13)."
China’s economy is expected to grow at a pace of about 7.7 per cent over the
projection horizon. This represents a slight pickup from the recent rate of
"growth, but is a somewhat weaker forecast than in the July Report."
Government spending on infrastructure should provide some support to
"growth over the projection period, but likely to a more limited extent than the"
stimulus measures introduced during the previous slowdown. Near-term
growth in exports is expected to be dampened by weak activity in a number
of advanced economies before picking up in mid-2013. Some additional
"slowing in housing is anticipated, although there is evidence that the housing"
"market has recently stabilized, following a significant deceleration in activity."
"4	 In April 2014, Japan’s value-added tax on consumption will increase to 8 per cent from 5 per cent, and"
then rise to 10 per cent in October 2015.
Japan’s real GDP growth is
projected to average only about
1 per cent in 2013 and 2014
China’s economy is expected to

"Inflationary pressures in China appear well contained, with consumer price"
inflation at only 1.9 per cent in September compared with 6.1 per cent a year
"ago. However, since food represents a large portion of household expendi-"
"tures, rising world food prices caused by severe droughts in a number of"
major food-producing countries are expected to exert significant upward
pressure on China’s inflation in coming quarters (Chart 14). Although the
"People’s Bank of China eased monetary policy earlier this year, higher inflation"
due to rising food prices may limit the scope for further easing. Significant
monetary policy easing may also be constrained by the fear of exacerbating
"existing domestic imbalances, particularly in the housing sector."
Economic activity in several other large EMEs is also slowing in response to
both external and domestic factors. After registering the lowest GDP growth
"since the financial crisis, activity in India appears to be weakening further,"
reflecting softer private consumption and investment. Recent indicators also
suggest that GDP growth in Brazil will remain subdued in the second half of
"2012. Owing to reduced near-term inflationary pressures, many EMEs have"
"lowered their policy interest rates. As in China, however, further easing could"
be tempered by expected increases in food prices and still-elevated credit
growth. Economic growth in the other large EMEs is expected to pick up
gradually in the second half of 2013 as a result of the recent policy easing
and somewhat stronger export markets.
Commodity Prices
Prices for many commodities have increased since the July Report. A rise in
"crude oil prices and a rebound in base metal prices, both partly related to the"
"announcement of new policy stimulus measures in several countries, account"
for much of the recent movement. Oil prices measured by the Brent crude
benchmark are about 23 per cent higher than the trough reached at the end
"of June, boosted by temporary supply disruptions in the North Sea and ten-"
"sions in the Middle East. In contrast, while higher relative to their July level,"
crude oil prices captured by the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) benchmark
"have fallen in recent weeks, reflecting strong supply conditions in North"

America. The latest futures curves suggest that the spread between Brent
crude oil prices and WTI prices will gradually narrow over the projection
"horizon, owing to some normalization of supply conditions (Chart 15). Relative"
"to the July Report, futures curves also indicate that Brent and WTI oil prices"
"will be about 10 per cent and 5 per cent higher, respectively, through 2014."
Natural gas prices in North America have also risen since the July Report
"but, at a little above US$3 per million Btu, are still low as new fracking"
technologies continue to drive an expansion of supply. Based on the latest
"futures curve, natural gas prices are projected to continue to rise through"
"2014, similar to expectations in July."
"Prices for non-energy commodities are also higher, on average, than in July,"
and are projected to stay above the levels anticipated at the time of the last
"Report through 2014, although substantial variation has been observed"
across some commodity groups over the past few months. Base metal prices
"have increased sharply since mid-August, offsetting part of the significant"
decline in prices observed earlier in the year. These prices are expected to
"continue increasing, albeit at a slower pace, over the projection horizon."
Prices for agricultural products have broadly stabilized since the July Report
after a drought-related spike. While agricultural prices are expected to remain
"elevated through mid-2013, they are projected to decline thereafter as supply"
"conditions improve. Prices for forestry products, after rising through August,"
have returned to the levels observed at the time of the July Report. Over the
"next two years, the prices of forestry products are expected to improve grad-"
"ually, supported by the recovery of the U.S. housing sector."

"annual revisions to U.S. data, the level of the foreign activity measure is"
slightly lower than previously expected in the second quarter of 2012.
"However, upward revisions to the Bank’s outlook for the U.S. economy imply"
stronger growth in the foreign activity measure over the projection horizon.
The foreign activity measure is expected to surpass its pre-recession level
during the second half of 2013.
The Bank of Canada’s commodity price index (BCPI) has increased by
"approximately 6 per cent since July, contributing to an improvement in"
Canada’s terms of trade (Chart 17). Prices received by Canadian producers
"of heavy crude oil, Western Canada Select (WCS), are up 13 per cent, owing"
in part to the resolution of pipeline and refinery outages that had previously
"weighed on prices. As a result, the spread between WCS and WTI has nar-"
rowed significantly. The BCPI is anticipated to remain relatively stable. A
projected rise in natural gas prices and the continued recovery in base
metal prices are expected to be offset by a gradual decrease in crude oil
prices and some easing in agricultural prices.
Canadian Dollar
"The Canadian dollar has averaged 101 cents U.S. since the July Report,"
"higher than the 98 cents U.S. assumed in July (Chart 18), and is assumed to"
average 101 cents U.S. over the projection horizon.

Bank of Canada  •  Monetary Policy Report  •  October 2012
Canadian Economy
"While global headwinds continue to restrain Canadian economic activity,"
domestic factors are supporting a moderate expansion. Following the recent
"period of below-potential growth, the Bank expects the economy to pick up in"
"coming quarters, returning to full capacity by the end of 2013. The Bank con-"
tinues to anticipate that the expansion will be driven mainly by growth in con-
"sumption and business investment, reflecting very stimulative domestic"
financial conditions. Housing activity is expected to decline from historically
"high levels, and household debt ratios are expected to rise further before"
stabilizing by the end of the projection horizon. Canadian exports are pro-
jected to pick up gradually but remain below their pre-recession peak until the
"first half of 2014, reflecting the weak level of foreign demand and ongoing"
competitiveness challenges. These challenges include the persistent strength
"of the Canadian dollar, which is being influenced by safe-haven flows and"
spillovers from global monetary policy.
"Core inflation has been lower than expected in recent months, reflecting"
somewhat softer prices across a wide range of goods and services. Core
"inflation is expected to increase gradually over coming quarters, reaching"
2 per cent by the middle of 2013 as the current small degree of slack in the
"economy is gradually absorbed, the growth of labour compensation stays"
moderate and inflation expectations remain well anchored. Total CPI infla-
"tion has fallen noticeably below the 2 per cent target, as expected, and is"
"projected to return to target by the end of 2013, somewhat later than pre­"
viously anticipated.
Financial Conditions
"In a context of somewhat improved global financial conditions, the supply"
and price of credit for businesses and households in Canada remain very
"stimulative (Chart 19), providing important ongoing support to the economic"
expansion.
Canadian financial markets have benefited from the modest reduction in
global risk aversion in recent months. The S&P/TSX Composite Index has
"risen by roughly 8 per cent since the July Report, and volatility has diminished"
(Chart 20). Credit spreads on Canadian corporate bonds have continued to
"narrow, more than offsetting the slight increase in Canadian government bond"
"yields. As a result, all-in corporate bond yields have fallen to record lows, and"
the volume of corporate bond issuance has remained robust.
"Canadian banks continue to be well positioned to lend, with ready access to"
low-cost funding across the term structure in both Canadian and foreign
"currencies, on both a relative and absolute basis. Responses to the Bank’s"
latest Senior Loan Officer Survey (available on the Bank’s website under

"easing in business lending conditions in recent months, extending a period"
of almost uninterrupted easing since late 2009 (Chart 21).
"With financing conditions for Canadian firms remaining highly favourable,"
overall business credit has expanded in recent months at a rate above its
"historical average (Chart 22). However, the demand for credit stemming"
from the solid growth in business investment continues to be tempered by
the historically high cash position of non-financial firms.

"household credit somewhat. Nevertheless, the household debt-to-income"
ratio is expected to continue to rise before stabilizing by the end of the
projection horizon.6
While growth in the narrow monetary aggregates remains moderate com-
"pared with the unusually rapid pace observed in late 2011, it has edged up in"
"recent months, suggesting a slightly greater degree of liquidity preference,"
particularly among companies. Growth in the broad monetary aggregates
"has also picked up from earlier in the year, although it continues to be con-"
sistent with relatively subdued inflationary pressures ahead.
Potential Output Growth
The Bank’s projection for the growth of potential output in Canada over the
2012–14 period is unchanged from the projection in the October 2011
Report (Box 2). Potential output growth is expected to increase from
2.0 per cent in 2012 to 2.2 per cent in 2014. The projection horizon has now
"been extended to 2015, when the growth of potential output is expected to"
"be 2.1 per cent. As a result of the recovery in investment spending, as well"
"as efficiency gains, trend productivity is projected to improve as Canadian"
firms strive to adopt best practices in the face of competitive pressures. At
"the same time, demographic forces will continue to reduce the trend rate of"
labour input growth.
"6	 On 9 July 2012, four measures for new government-backed insured mortgages with loan-to-value ratios"
of more than 80 per cent were implemented. These measures: (i) reduced the maximum amortiza-
tion period to 25 years from 30 years; (ii) lowered the maximum amount Canadians can borrow when
refinancing to 80 per cent from 85 per cent of the value of their homes; (iii) fixed the maximum gross
debt-service ratio at 39 per cent and the maximum total debt-service ratio at 44 per cent; and (iv) limited
the availability of government-backed insured mortgages to homes with a purchase price of less than
"$1 million. Moreover, the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions also announced new"
guidelines for residential mortgage underwriting effective at the end of October 2012.
Potential output growth is
expected to increase from
2.0 per cent in 2012 to
2.2 per cent in 2014
Box 2
Revisions to Potential Output Growth
"Every October, the Bank reassesses the path for potential"
output growth underpinning its economic outlook. Potential
output represents the level of goods and services that the
economy can produce on a sustained basis without adding
to inflationary pressures. Potential output growth can be
thought of as the sum of the growth rates of trend labour
input and trend labour productivity.
The growth rate of potential output is expected to increase
"gradually from 2.0 per cent in 2012 to 2.2 per cent in 2014,"
"reflecting higher trend productivity growth, before edging"
down to 2.1 per cent in 2015 (Table 2-A). The slowing in
2015 results from a further decline in the growth of trend
labour input coupled with no change in the growth rate of
trend labour productivity.
The projected improvement in the growth of trend labour
"productivity is supported by solid investment spending,"
aided by very low interest rates and the relatively low cost
of imported investment goods associated with the strong
"Canadian dollar, as well as by international competitiveness"
pressures that encourage Canadian firms to adopt best
practices. Growth in trend labour productivity is projected
"to rise from 1.2 per cent in 2012 to 1.5 per cent in 2014, and"
to remain at 1.5 per cent in 2015.
The growth rate of trend labour input over the projection
horizon is expected to moderate from 0.8 per cent in 2012
"to 0.6 per cent in 2015, driven by slower growth in the"
working-age population as well as a decline in the trend
employment rate. Demographics are expected to have a
continuing effect beyond 2015.

Bank of Canada  •  Monetary Policy Report  •  October 2012
Estimated Pressures on Capacity
The Canadian economy continues to operate with a small amount of spare
capacity. While real GDP growth of 1.9 per cent in the second quarter was
"broadly in line with the growth of potential output, as expected, historical"
revisions to the National Accounts suggest slightly less economic slack in
Canada through 2011 and early 2012 than previously estimated (Box 3).
"However, real GDP growth is estimated to have been weaker than antici-"
"pated at around 1.0 per cent in the third quarter, partly reflecting the"
impact on Canadian exports of transitory disruptions in the energy sector.
"Consistent with these dynamics, the Bank’s conventional measure of the"
output gap widened slightly to -0.7 per cent in the third quarter (Chart 23).
"Taken together, other indicators of pressures on capacity also point to the"
persistence of a small degree of slack in the Canadian economy. Responses
to the Bank’s Business Outlook Survey in recent quarters have shown that
the proportion of firms that would have difficulty meeting an unexpected
"increase in demand has stayed close to its historical average, and while"
"the proportion of firms reporting labour shortages has edged up, it is still"
"slightly below its historical average. Despite solid gains in employment,"
"the unemployment rate has been broadly steady over the past year, at a"
level consistent with a modest degree of slack in the economy (Chart 24).
"Moreover, both the duration of unemployment and the proportion of involun-"
tary part-time workers continue to be elevated (Chart 25).
"On balance, the Bank judges that the economy was operating at roughly"
two-thirds of a per cent below its production capacity in the third quarter of
"2012, a slightly larger degree of slack than expected in July."

Historical Revisions to the Canadian System of National Accounts
"In October 2012, Statistics Canada published revised esti-"
mates for Canada’s System of National Accounts .1  The new
data refl
ect the implementation of revised international
"accounting standards, including classifi"
"cation changes, as"
well as new and improved source data and methodologies .
The nature of the revisions is such that new and old data
are sometimes not directly comparable . Three revisions in
particular bear mentioning:
• Spending on research and development is now capital-
"ized, resulting in an upward revision to the level of both"
"business and government investment over history, by"
"an average of 5 per cent and 9 per cent, respectively ."
While this contributes to an upward revision to the
average level of overall real GDP of 3 per cent since
"1981, there is no signifi"
cant change in the profi
le of real
GDP growth (Chart 3-A) . The revisions do not alter the
"depth or length of the recent recession, and leave the"
broad profi
le of the Bank’s conventional estimate of the
output gap roughly unchanged . Revisions to real GDP in
"recent quarters, largely owing to improved source data,"
suggest a slightly faster pace of growth since the begin-
"ning of 2011, resulting in a marginally smaller output"
gap in the second quarter of 2012 than previously
estimated .
1 Revisions to the National Accounts cover the period from
"1981Q1 to 2012Q2, while revisions to the National Balance Sheet"
Accounts cover the period from 1990Q1 to 2012Q2.
• The new System of National Accounts redefi
nes insti-
"tutional sectors; in particular, households, non-profi"
t
institutions and Aboriginal governments are now separ-
ated out . The revised defi
nition of the household sector
contributes to a lower estimated level of disposable
"income .2 In addition, the estimated level of debt held"
"by households has been revised, owing primarily to"
changes in methodology and a new approach to allo-
"cating loans across sectors . As a result, household debt"
relative to disposable income under the new defi
nition
"is higher in recent years, and shows a faster pace of"
increase (Chart 3-B) .
3  Household net worth relative
to disposable income has also been revised higher
under the new defi
"nition, and is now estimated to have"
"rebounded more strongly coming out of the recession,"
partly refl
ecting more extensive marking-to-market of
"asset values (Chart 3-C) .4 Finally, the household savings"
rate has been revised downward over most of its his-
"tory, although it has been adjusted somewhat higher in"
"recent years (Chart 3-D) . At the margin, these revisions"
imply a more vulnerable household sector than previ-
ously thought .
2 Household disposable income is also lower because it now excludes
interest on household debt payable.
3 The revisions to income account for most of the change to the level of this
"ratio, while the faster growth of the ratio owes mainly to the revisions to debt."
"4 For instance, valuation of unlisted shares at market value rather than at book"
value added approximately $108 billion to household net worth in 2011.

The Bank expects growth in the Canadian economy to pick up in coming
quarters to a somewhat faster pace than that of its production potential
"(Chart 26). On an average annual basis, real GDP growth is forecast to"
increase from 2.2 per cent in 2012 to 2.3 per cent in 2013 and 2.4 per cent in
2014 (Table 2). Although available indicators suggest that growth in the third
"quarter of this year was weaker than expected, the annual growth rate for"
"2012 is higher than in the July Report, owing largely to revisions that show"

stronger growth in the third and fourth quarters of 2011 than previously
estimated.7 The outlook for growth is broadly similar to that expected in the
July Report (Table 3).
The Bank continues to anticipate that consumption and business fixed
investment will be the primary drivers of real GDP growth over the projection
"horizon, supported by accommodative domestic financial conditions"
(Chart 27). The pickup in growth from its trough in the third quarter of this
year is expected to be driven primarily by a modest increase in net exports.
This balances ongoing competitiveness challenges with the projected
"7	 Economic growth in the third and fourth quarters of 2011 was 5.8 per cent and 2.1 per cent, respectively,"
revised up from 4.5 per cent and 1.9 per cent. This stronger growth has the effect of lifting the average level
"of GDP in 2012, other things equal, thus contributing to a higher rate of annual average growth this year."

"improvement in the growth of foreign activity, which is expected to pick up"
from an average rate of 3.5 per cent over the second and third quarters of
2012 to roughly 7 per cent over the projection horizon (Chart 16). The out-
"look for final domestic demand is slightly weaker than in the July Report,"
although the changes are relatively small. While the recent further easing in
financial conditions and the favourable effects of higher terms of trade on
Canadian incomes and wealth should provide additional support to
"domestic demand, recent indicators suggest slightly less momentum in"
residential and business fixed investment than previously projected.
"Growth in household spending has been moderate. Growth in consumption,"
"which was weak through the first half of 2012, is estimated to have picked"
up in the third quarter. Housing investment declined in the second and third
"With signs of overbuilding, the"
level of housing investment still

"quarters, following strong gains over the previous three quarters."
"Nonetheless, with signs of overbuilding, the level of housing investment still"
remains near historical highs (Chart 28).
It is possible that the elevated level of household debt is beginning to induce
"a more cautious attitude among Canadian households. As a result, the"
Bank’s outlook for growth in household spending is little changed from the
"July Report, despite the supportive impact of improved financial conditions"
and higher terms of trade in recent months. Growth in consumption is thus
"expected to be moderate over the projection horizon, at a rate slightly below"
"that of disposable income (Chart 29), resulting in a small increase in the"
personal savings rate (Chart 30). Residential investment is projected to
"contract, with its share of the overall economy declining from the current"
"elevated level (Chart 31). In this regard, the measures implemented in recent"
months by federal authorities are expected to contribute to a more sustain-
able housing market in Canada.
The comprehensive revisions to the System of National Accounts did not
alter the recent broad profile of household spending. There are a few note-
"worthy adjustments, however. The household savings rate is now estimated"
"to have been higher in recent years than previously reported, although it is"
"generally lower than previously estimated prior to 2006 (Box 3). In addition,"
"household net worth is now estimated to be higher than previously reported,"
"showing a stronger recovery since the recession. Finally, the household"
debt-to-income ratio is now estimated to be 161 per cent as of the second
"quarter of 2012, a more elevated level than previously thought."
The Bank continues to forecast solid growth in business fixed investment over
the projection horizon. This forecast reflects the strong financial positions of
"Canadian firms (Chart 32), favourable credit conditions, high commodity"
"prices and the strong Canadian dollar, as well as the impetus to improve"
productivity amid heightened pressures to become more competitive.
Although these factors have been marginally more supportive to the outlook

"for capital spending in recent months, the projected growth profile for busi-"
ness fixed investment is somewhat less robust than in the July Report
"(Box 3, Chart 3-E). This is mainly because global economic uncertainty"
appears to be having a larger impact on the capital spending plans of
"Canadian businesses, as reflected in the less-positive responses to the"
"Bank’s autumn Business Outlook Survey. Moreover, many firms reported"
"that following the recent completion of significant projects, they would now"
focus on achieving a more intensive use of existing capital.
Government spending is expected to contribute modestly to real GDP
"growth over the projection horizon. As in the July base-case scenario, these"
contributions are projected to be considerably weaker than has been typical
"historically (Chart 33), in line with the plans of federal and provincial govern-"
ments to consolidate spending.

The recovery in net exports is expected to remain weak. Growth in Canada’s
exports is projected to pick up but remain relatively moderate despite
"stronger growth in foreign activity (Chart 16), owing to ongoing competitive-"
"ness challenges, including the persistent strength of the Canadian dollar."
"As a result, the level of Canada’s exports is not forecast to regain its pre-"
"recession peak until the first half of 2014 (Chart 34). In contrast, the level of"
"imports has already returned to its pre-recession peak. Partly as a result,"
Canada’s current account balance has declined from a surplus before the
recession to a deficit of around 4 per cent of GDP. This sizable current
"account deficit, which has been somewhat larger in recent quarters than"
"previously estimated, is projected to diminish gradually over the forecast"
horizon (Chart 35).

"The projected growth in exports is slightly stronger than in the July Report,"
with the higher assumed value of the Canadian dollar only partly offsetting
the stronger-than-anticipated growth profile for U.S. business investment
and the somewhat firmer recovery from low levels of U.S. demand for
"housing and automobiles. The projected growth in imports is similar to July,"
"despite the higher assumed value for the Canadian dollar, reflecting the"
"marginally weaker outlook for domestic demand. As a result, the projected"

Bank of Canada  •  Monetary Policy Report  •  October 2012
"Given the above projection for real GDP, the Canadian economy is"
expected to gradually absorb the currently small amount of slack in
"coming quarters, reaching full capacity by the end of 2013, slightly later"
than in the July Report.
Inflation
"Core CPI inflation averaged 1.5 per cent in the third quarter, down from an"
average of 2.0 per cent in the first half of the year. Alternative measures of core
inflation have also fallen below 2 per cent in recent months (Chart 36). The
"decline in core CPI inflation has been greater than anticipated, reflecting some-"
"what softer prices across a wide range of goods and services. In contrast,"
"gasoline prices have been firmer than expected in recent months, reflecting"
"both higher world prices for crude oil and higher margins. As a result, total CPI"
inflation was in line with the Bank’s expectations at 1.2 per cent in the third
"quarter, down from 1.6 per cent in the second quarter and 2.4 per cent in the"
first quarter (Chart 37).
Inflation expectations remain well anchored. The October Consensus
Economics forecasts for total CPI inflation in 2012 and 2013 were
"1.8 per cent and 1.9 per cent, respectively. As reported in the Bank’s"
"autumn Business Outlook Survey, almost all firms surveyed continue to"
expect average inflation over the next two years to remain within the 1 to
3 per cent inflation-control range. Market-based measures of longer-term
inflation expectations also continue to be consistent with the 2 per cent
inflation-control target.
Core inflation is expected to remain subdued in the near term before
increasing gradually in coming quarters to reach 2 per cent by the middle
"of 2013, as the economy gradually absorbs the current small degree of"
slack and inflation expectations remain well anchored (Chart 37). In addi-
"tion, growth in labour compensation is expected to stay moderate, con-"
"sistent with recent trends in wage growth (Chart 38), thus contributing to"
The Canadian economy is
expected to reach full capacity
by the end of 2013
The decline in core CPI
inflation has been greater
than anticipated
Gasoline prices have been
firmer than expected
Inflation expectations remain
well anchored
Core inflation is expected to
remain subdued in the near
term before increasing gradually
in coming quarters to reach
2 per cent by the middle of 2013

"the projected stability in inflation. As previously assumed, the indirect"
effects associated with the restoration of the provincial sales tax in British
Columbia are expected to have a minor effect on core inflation over the
projection horizon.8
"This projection for core inflation is weaker than in the July Report. Similarly,"
total CPI inflation is expected to remain below 2 per cent for a somewhat
"longer period than previously anticipated, converging to the target by the"
"end of 2013. In addition to the lower profile for core inflation, this reflects a"
larger expected decline in gasoline prices from current elevated levels over
the bulk of the projection horizon.
This projection includes a gradual reduction in monetary stimulus over the
"projection horizon, consistent with achieving the inflation target."
The uncertainty surrounding the Bank’s inflation projection is illustrated
using fan charts. Chart 39 and Chart 40 depict the 50 per cent and
90 per cent confidence bands for year-over-year core inflation and total CPI
inflation from the fourth quarter of 2012 to the end of 2014.

Bank of Canada  •  Monetary Policy Report  •  October 2012
Risks to the Outlook
"The inflation outlook in Canada is subject to significant risks. In particular,"
the Bank’s projection assumes that authorities in Europe are able to contain
"the ongoing crisis, and that the U.S. fiscal cliff will be avoided. Imbalances in"
the Canadian household sector remain the biggest domestic risk. This risk is
two-sided.
The three main upside risks to inflation in Canada relate to the possibility
"of higher global inflationary pressures, stronger Canadian exports and"
renewed momentum in Canadian residential investment.

 Global inflationary pressures could be more persistent than currently
projected if potential output in advanced economies is lower than antici-
"pated or if the substantial, additional monetary policy stimulus provided"
by major central banks boosts prices more than expected.

 Growth in Canadian exports could be stronger than expected if exporters
improve their competitiveness more rapidly than currently assumed or if
output growth in the United States is stronger than projected.

 While residential investment in Canada has softened recently after
"reaching record-high levels, it could regain momentum, thereby"
­
reinforcing existing imbalances.
The three main downside risks to inflation in Canada relate to the European
"crisis, weaker demand for Canadian exports and the possibility that growth"
in Canadian household spending could be weaker.

 Failure to contain the crisis in Europe is the most serious risk facing the
global and Canadian economies. The effects on Canada through finan-
"cial, confidence and trade channels would be substantial, given the size"
and importance of the euro area to the global economy.

 Demand for Canadian exports could be weaker than expected if the
authorities in the United States do not smooth the path of fiscal consolida-
"tion to avoid the fiscal cliff, if the slowdown in emerging-market economies"
"is greater than expected, or if unconventional policy measures undertaken"
by foreign authorities have an outsized effect on exchange rates.

 Continuing high household debt levels in Canada could lead to a sharper-
"than-expected deceleration in household spending. Relatedly, if there"
"were a sudden weakening in the Canadian housing sector, it could have"
sizable spillover effects on other areas of the economy.
"Overall, the Bank judges that the risks to the inflation outlook in Canada are"
roughly balanced over the projection period.
