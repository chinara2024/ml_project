CANADA’S INFLATION-CONTROL STRATEGY*
Inﬂ
ation control and the economy
Inﬂ
ation control is not an end in itself; it is the means whereby monetary policy contributes to
•
solid economic performance.
"Low, stable, and predictable inﬂ"
ation allows the economy to function more effectively. This
•
contributes to better economic growth over time and works to moderate cyclical ﬂ
uctuations in
output and employment.
The monetary policy instrument
Announcements regarding the Bank’s policy instrument—the target overnight interest rate—take
•
"place, under normal circumstances, on eight pre-speciﬁ"
ed dates during the year.
"In setting a target for the overnight rate, the Bank of Canada inﬂ"
uences short-term interest rates
•
to achieve a rate of monetary expansion consistent with the inﬂ
ation-control target. The trans-
mission mechanism is complex and involves long and variable lags—the impact on inﬂ
ation from
changes in policy rates is usually spread over six to eight quarters.
The targets
"In February 1991, the federal government and the Bank of Canada jointly agreed on a series of"
•
targets for reducing total CPI inﬂ
ation to the midpoint of a range of 1 to 3 per cent by the end of
1995. The inﬂ
"ation target has been extended a number of times. In November 2006, the agree-"
ment was renewed for a period of ﬁ
"ve years to the end of 2011. Under this agreement, the Bank"
will continue to conduct monetary policy aimed at keeping total CPI inﬂ
"ation at 2 per cent, with a"
control range of 1 to 3 per cent around the target.
Monitoring inﬂ
ation
"In the short run, a good deal of movement in the CPI is caused by transitory ﬂ"
uctuations in the
•
"prices of such volatile components as fruit and gasoline, as well as by changes in indirect taxes."
"For this reason, the Bank uses a core measure of CPI inﬂ"
ation as an indicator of the underlying
trend in inﬂ
ation. This core measure excludes eight of the most volatile components of the CPI
and adjusts the remaining components to remove the effect of changes in indirect taxes.

OVERVIEW
BANK OF CANADA    MONETARY POLICY REPORT    OCTOBER 2009 1
This report includes information received up to the ﬁ
xed announcement date on 20 October 2009.
Overview
"Recent indicators point to the start of a global recovery from a deep, syn-"
chronous recession. Global economic and ﬁ
nancial developments have been
"somewhat more favourable than expected at the time of the July Report,"
although signiﬁ
cant fragilities remain.
A recovery in economic activity is also under way in Canada. This resumption
of growth is supported by monetary and ﬁ
"scal stimulus, increased house-"
"hold wealth, improving ﬁ"
"nancial conditions, higher commodity prices, and"
stronger business and consumer conﬁ
"dence. However, heightened volatility"
and persistent strength in the Canadian dollar are working to slow growth
and subdue inﬂ
"ation pressures. The current strength in the dollar is expected,"
"over time, to more than fully offset the favourable developments since July."
"Given all of these factors, the Bank now projects that, relative to the July"
"Report, the composition of aggregate demand will shift further towards ﬁ"
nal
domestic demand and away from net exports. Growth is expected to be
slightly higher in the second half of this year than previously projected but to
average slightly lower over the balance of the projection period. The Canadian
"economy is projected to grow by 3.0 per cent in 2010 and 3.3 per cent in 2011,"
after contracting by 2.4 per cent this year. This is a somewhat more modest
recovery in Canada than the average of previous economic cycles.
The Bank now expects that the output gap will be closed in the third quarter
"of 2011, one quarter later than it had projected in July. Correspondingly,"
inﬂ
ation is also expected to return to the 2 per cent target in the third quarter
"of 2011, one quarter later than in July’s projection."
"The risks to the outlook remain elevated, although they have diminished"
"somewhat since the July Report, with accumulating evidence of a recovery in"
the global and Canadian economies.
The main upside risks to inﬂ
ation relate to the possibility of a stronger-than-
anticipated recovery in the global economy. A stronger global recovery would
"be transmitted to Canada via trade, ﬁ"
"nancial, conﬁ"
"dence, and commodity-"
price channels. There is also the risk that Canadian domestic demand could
be more robust and have a more sustained momentum than projected.
"On the downside, a stronger-than-assumed Canadian dollar, driven by global"
"portfolio movements out of U.S.-dollar assets, could act as a signiﬁ"
cant
further drag on growth and put additional downward pressure on inﬂ
ation.
Another important downside risk is that the global recovery could be even
"more protracted than projected if self-sustaining growth in private demand,"
"which will be required for a solid recovery, takes longer than expected to"
materialize.

"Over the medium term, global macroeconomic imbalances continue to pose"
signiﬁ
cant risks to the outlook.
While the underlying macroeconomic risks to the projection are roughly bal-
"anced, the Bank judges that, as a consequence of operating at the effective"
"lower bound, the overall risks to its inﬂ"
ation projection are tilted slightly to the
downside.
"On 10 September and 20 October, the Bank reafﬁ"
rmed its conditional
commitment to maintain its target for the overnight rate at its current level of
1/4 per cent until the end of the second quarter of 2010 in order to achieve
the inﬂ
"ation target. In its conduct of monetary policy at low interest rates, the"
Bank retains considerable ﬂ
"exibility, consistent with the framework outlined in"
the April Report.

BANK OF CANADA    MONETARY POLICY REPORT    OCTOBER 2009 3
Recent Developments
"Recent indicators point to the start of a global recovery, following a deep,"
synchronous global recession. Economic and ﬁ
nancial developments have
been somewhat more favourable than expected at the time of the July
"Monetary Policy Report, although signiﬁ"
cant fragilities remain. Vigorous and
coordinated ﬁ
"scal and monetary policy stimulus in the G-20 economies,"
including a wide range of measures to support the ﬂ
"ow of credit, have been"
"sustaining aggregate demand, but evidence of self-sustaining private"
demand remains modest. Necessary adjustments on both the real and ﬁ
nan-
"cial sides of the global economy are under way, and will involve a signiﬁ"
cant
"and protracted rotation of global demand, as well as deleveraging by U.S."
"and European banks, households, and ﬁ"
rms.
"Led primarily by Asian economies, the turnaround in global output began in"
"the second quarter, slightly earlier than anticipated. In the euro area and"
"North American economies, real GDP declined further in the second quarter,"
"as expected, although at a much slower pace than in preceding quarters."
More recent monthly data suggest that global output picked up in the third
"quarter, partly reﬂ"
ecting the impact of the temporary ﬁ
scal measures that
"have been adopted in most major economies, as well as a short-term boost"
to growth from a turn in the inventory cycle (Chart 1).
"In the United States, annual comprehensive revisions to the national accounts"
"show that, through the ﬁ"
"rst quarter of 2009, the recession was even deeper"
"than previously estimated.1 However, as expected, real GDP declined at a"
much slower pace in the second quarter of 2009. Despite sizable ﬁ
scal stim-
"ulus, ﬁ"
"nal domestic demand continued to fall, with additional reductions in"
household consumption and further large declines in private ﬁ
xed investment.
De-stocking also continued during the second quarter. More recent indica-
"tors, such as an improvement in consumer conﬁ"
dence and a rise in new
"manufacturing orders, point to a rebound in aggregate real economic activity"
"in the third quarter. However, this rebound appears to be related largely to a"
turn in the inventory cycle and to the temporary support provided by govern-
ment stimulus programs. The U.S. government’s Car Allowance Rebate
"System (CARS), which ended in late August, provided a major boost to auto"
"sales and production during the third quarter. At the same time, aided partly"
by the government’s tax credit program for ﬁ
"rst-time homebuyers, the"
"housing sector appears to have bottomed out, and some ﬁ"
rming in house
prices is evident.
1 The decline in real GDP through the ﬁ
"rst quarter of 2009, from its peak in the second quarter of 2008, is now 3.7 per cent,"
compared with the previously reported 3.1 per cent.
Recent indicators point to the start of
"a global recovery, following a deep,"
synchronous global recession.
Necessary adjustments on both the
real and ﬁ
nancial sides of the global
economy are under way.
"In the United States, recent indicators"
point to a rebound in real economic
activity.

Real economic activity in major overseas countries was stronger than
"expected, with France, Germany, and Japan all recording positive growth in"
"the second quarter. Growth in the euro area as a whole contracted slightly,"
but still exceeded expectations. The favourable developments in Europe
mainly reﬂ
"ect more robust household spending, buoyed by temporary"
""
government incentive programs for car purchases and substantial support
from automatic stabilizers. The combination of inventory adjustments that
"appear to be well advanced, relatively strong data for new orders in the"
""
"manufacturing sector, more positive surveys for the services sector, and a"
general improvement in household and business conﬁ
dence suggests that
the euro area economy troughed in the second quarter. Growth in Japan was
supported by government cash transfers to low-income households and tax
rebates on energy-efﬁ
cient vehicles and home appliances. A rebound in
exports of automobiles and electronics from a very weak level also contrib-
uted to stronger real GDP growth.
Economic growth in China in the second quarter was also stronger than
"anticipated, reﬂ"
ecting the impact of massive ﬁ
scal stimulus concentrated in
infrastructure projects and incentives for consumer spending. Rapid credit
expansion has also fuelled a sharp pickup in consumption and investment. In
"the rest of the world, following a larger-than-anticipated contraction in the ﬁ"
rst
"quarter, available data suggest that growth resumed in the second quarter."
"There are considerable disparities across regions, however, with emerging"
"economies in Asia rebounding the most strongly, aided by the strength in"
China and by supportive macroeconomic policies.
"World oil prices and, to a lesser extent, non-energy commodity prices"
""
(particularly metals) have ﬁ
rmed since their trough in the ﬁ
"rst quarter, but"
nonetheless remain well below the levels reached in mid-2008 (Chart 2). A
"strong increase in demand from China, associated with large, commodity-"
intensive infrastructure projects and some accumulation for investment
""
"purposes, has been a key contributor to the recent rise in commodity prices."
The improved outlook for demand and the reduction in ﬁ
nancing costs have
"provided greater incentives for companies to build inventories. These factors,"
"together with supply cuts by OPEC, have also helped boost world oil prices."
Real economic activity in major over-
seas countries was stronger than
expected.
Commodity prices have ﬁ
rmed.

"In contrast to developments in the oil sector, natural gas prices have"
remained relatively low because of the considerable excess supply in the
"North American market, stemming mainly from a shift in U.S. production"
towards unconventional sources (shale gas) (Technical Box 1).
"As expected, total consumer price inﬂ"
ation has fallen sharply around the
"world since mid-2008, reﬂ"
ecting the sizable decline in oil and other com-
"modity prices through early 2009. Indeed, annual rates of total inﬂ"
ation in
most advanced economies are now below zero (Chart 3). The emergence of
excess supply has also dampened underlying inﬂ
ation rates. This downward
pressure on core inﬂ
"ation has been mitigated in many economies, however,"
"by the aggressive monetary policy actions taken early in the crisis (Chart 4),"
which have helped to anchor long-term inﬂ
"ation expectations, and also by"
"price and wage rigidities, particularly in the services sector."
Annual rates of total CPI inﬂ
ation in
most advanced economies are now
below zero.

Recent Developments in the Natural Gas Sector
"than that of crude oil, despite the increase in the ratio"
of net exports of crude oil to GDP in recent years
"(Table 1-A). From 1996 to 2005, the natural gas sec-"
tor’s share of Canadian total gross output has more
"than tripled, increasing from 0.6 per cent to 2 per"
cent.
2 The sector’s share of total Canadian production
by 2005 was roughly the same as that of crude oil.
The weaker proﬁ
le for natural gas prices in recent
quarters has reduced drilling activity and will depress
investment in this sector for a period of time.
World prices for many commodities have risen since
"the start of the year, with the important exception of"
natural gas. After reaching a high of over US$13/Mbtu
"in mid-2008, natural gas prices are now hovering near"
"US$4/Mbtu, up slightly from their recent lows. Oil"
"prices, however, have increased substantially in 2009"
"(Chart 1-A). Since 1980, the ratio of the price of a"
barrel of crude oil to the price of an Mbtu of natural
gas has been approximately 9:1; the current ratio of
around 21:1 is exceptionally high.
1 This divergence is
explained by the development of shale gas in the
"United States, which contributed to an 8 per cent"
rise in U.S. production in 2008 (one of the largest
"increases since the 1970s). Increased supply, com-"
bined with decreased demand resulting from the
"global economic downturn, has led to record storage"
levels and persistently low prices in the North
American market for natural gas (Chart 1-B).
This is a noteworthy development for the Canadian
"economy, given the importance of the natural gas"
sector for Canada’s exports. Its contribution to net
exports as a proportion of GDP has remained larger
1 The heat-content ratio of oil to natural gas is 6:1.

BANK OF CANADA    MONETARY POLICY REPORT    OCTOBER 2009 7
Developments in Global Financial Markets
Conditions in global ﬁ
nancial markets have improved substantially and some-
"what more rapidly than anticipated in recent months, consistent with the view"
that the global recession has bottomed out and that the probability of an
"extreme negative outcome has receded. These improvements, if sustained,"
will help repair household and business balance sheets and boost conﬁ
-
"dence, supporting growth in the real economy."
"Nevertheless, strains remain in certain markets, and further setbacks are"
"possible. Although signs of recovery are apparent, securitization markets are"
still operating at a fraction of their pre-crisis levels and credit conditions at
"banks are still relatively tight, owing to ongoing deleveraging. While recent"
"increases in asset prices are helping, the deterioration in loan quality associ-"
ated with the economic downturn is likely to prolong the deleveraging
""
process. Stimulative monetary policies and direct interventions in speciﬁ
c
markets have remained an important source of support.
Funding markets for ﬁ
"nancial institutions have been normalizing, with interest"
"rate levels reaching record lows, and spreads in short-term funding markets"
"falling below pre-Lehman levels (Chart 5). As a result, recourse to central"
"bank facilities has diminished considerably, and a number of central banks"
have begun to reduce some of their extraordinary liquidity programs.
"Increasingly, large ﬁ"
nancial institutions have also been able to access the
market for longer-term ﬁ
nancing without direct government guarantees.
Financing conditions for businesses have improved as well. For both ﬁ
nancial
and non-ﬁ
"nancial issuers, credit spreads are down substantially from their"
"peaks, although they remain elevated relative to their historical averages. With"
"the yields on benchmark government bonds remaining relatively low, overall"
corporate yields are now well below the levels that prevailed earlier this year
(Chart 6). Improved market access has contributed to a record amount of
global long-term corporate bond issuance since the beginning of the year. In
"addition, global equity markets have registered strong gains since the troughs"
reached in March.

nancial markets
have improved substantially and some-

Despite these marked improvements in global ﬁ
"nancial markets, bank lending"
conditions for households remain relatively tight outside of Canada. Banks in
the euro area and the United States continue to restrict access to credit for
"most types of loans, although surveys of senior loan ofﬁ"
cers show that the
pace of credit tightening is slowing. The combination of tighter credit condi-
tions and depressed demand have halted growth in household credit in the
euro area and produced outright contractions in the United States.
While policy interventions have helped to stabilize global ﬁ
nancial markets
"and to improve credit conditions, additional comprehensive and timely"
actions will be needed to put the recovery on a ﬁ
rm footing and reduce the
probability of future crises.

BANK OF CANADA    MONETARY POLICY REPORT    OCTOBER 2009 9
Outlook for the Global Economy
The outlook for global economic growth in the second half of 2009 and
"through 2010 has strengthened since the July Report, particularly for China"
"and smaller emerging economies in Asia. However, considerable uncertainty"
still surrounds the global outlook. The recovery is expected to be more
gradual than usual. This is because underlying private demand in many econ-
omies is expected to recover only slowly as signiﬁ
cant balance-sheet and
structural adjustments run their course. Experience shows that recessions
precipitated by ﬁ
nancial crises have larger and longer-lasting adverse effects
on potential output than do other types of recessions. The signiﬁ
cant rotation
in global demand that will be required to put growth on a sustainable path will
make the adjustment process especially challenging.
Our estimates suggest that the growth of global production potential will slow
""
from over 4 per cent in the years just prior to the crisis to about 3 per cent
"during the 2009−11 period. In that context, the Bank now expects the global"
"economy to shrink by 1.6 per cent in 2009, followed by growth of 3.1 per cent"
in 2010 and 4.0 per cent in 2011 (Table 1).
The gradual recovery is underpinned by the same factors highlighted in our
"previous projections. First, the ﬁ"
scal and monetary stimulus in place should
continue to support domestic demand. Part of this has already come through
"the effects of lower interest rates and rising asset prices on wealth. Second,"
a further gradual normalization of ﬁ
nancial markets and the completion of
deleveraging in the ﬁ
nancial sector should result in increased availability of
"credit to businesses and households. Third, the turn in the inventory cycle"
and the completion of stock adjustment in the housing sectors of several
economies should contribute positively to overall growth.
"With the level of world aggregate demand expected to recover only gradually,"
signiﬁ
cant excess capacity in the global economy should persist over the
"projection horizon, contributing to a subdued inﬂ"
ation proﬁ
le.
"In the United States, the pace of the recovery starting in the third quarter of"
"2009 is projected to be somewhat faster than in the July Report, since some"
of the ongoing adjustments in the economy appear to be more advanced
"than previously assumed. Fiscal stimulus, together with a positive boost from"
"inventories, should be key contributors to the recovery. The rebound in con-"
sumption expenditures is projected to be more moderate than in previous
"cycles, however, largely reﬂ"
ecting the need for households to rebuild savings
following the sharp decline in their wealth. This adjustment brings the share of
The outlook for global economic growth
"has strengthened since the July Report,"
particularly for China and smaller
emerging economies in Asia.
The Bank expects the global economy
"to shrink by 1.6 per cent in 2009,"
""
followed by growth of 3.1 per cent in

"In the euro area, the rebound in the second half of 2009 and in 2010 is also"
"projected to be somewhat stronger than in July, reﬂ"
ecting a larger impact
from the ﬁ
"scal stimulus than previously assumed. The recovery should, none-"
"theless, be more subdued than in the United States, partly because of less-"
aggressive policy actions and the greater adjustments still needed in the euro
area’s banking system. The recovery in household consumption will likely be
restrained by the deterioration in labour markets and relatively tight credit
"conditions. In Japan, the recovery is supported by the completion of the"
inventory correction and ongoing monetary and ﬁ
scal stimulus.
"Economic growth in China is expected to remain robust, supported by highly"
accommodative monetary and ﬁ
scal policies. Bank credit has been growing
"at an extraordinarily rapid rate, creating the possibility of some resource"
misallocation. Smaller emerging economies in Asia have already started to
"recover from a sharp downturn in industrial production and exports, and"
should continue to beneﬁ
t from a pickup in global trade and the solid
""
expansion in China. Other developing and emerging-market economies are
"expected to recover gradually over the coming years, aided by a resumption"
of capital ﬂ
ows and expansionary ﬁ
scal and monetary policies. The growing
contribution of developing and emerging-market economies to global
demand should provide further support to commodity prices (Chart 9). While
"there may be continued short-term volatility, commodity prices are projected"
to continue to increase as the global economy recovers in 2010 and 2011.

"Following three consecutive quarters of sharp contraction, economic growth"
has resumed in Canada. This recovery is supported by monetary and ﬁ
scal
"stimulus, increased household wealth, improving ﬁ"
"nancial conditions,"
stronger business and consumer conﬁ
"dence, the beginning of the recovery in"
"the global economy, and a strengthening in the terms of trade. The Bank’s"
base-case projection now sees slightly stronger growth in the second half of
2009 than was projected in the July Report. Over the balance of the projec-
"tion period, growth is slightly lower, reﬂ"
ecting the effect of the higher value of
the Canadian dollar. The economy is now projected to return to full capacity
"in the third quarter of 2011, one quarter later than anticipated in July."
Recent Developments
Aggregate Demand and Supply
"As expected, the recession in Canada deepened signiﬁ"
cantly in the second
"quarter, with real GDP falling by an additional 3.4 per cent (at annual rates), in"
line with the July projection. Real gross domestic income (GDI) also declined
"further, but at a much slower pace than in the previous two quarters, owing to"
a partial rebound in Canada’s terms of trade (Chart 10).

"In contrast, household spending began to recover in the second quarter in"
response to substantial monetary and ﬁ
scal stimulus and improved consumer
conﬁ
dence. Expenditures on consumer durables and residential investment
"picked up strongly. In addition to improved affordability, the sharp rebound in"
sales of existing homes reﬂ
ected pent-up demand from the height of the
ﬁ
nancial crisis (Chart 13). Fiscal incentives also helped to fuel renovation
"activity. Government expenditures were another important source of demand,"
contributing 1.2 percentage points to growth (at annual rates) in the quarter.
"Available indicators, including the recent pickup in employment, suggest that"
real GDP growth resumed in the third quarter. Household spending continued
"to recover, and the contribution of government expenditures increased."
Growth was also boosted by a substantial rise in Canadian automobile
""
"production, as major auto companies reopened some of the capacity they"
had shuttered earlier this year and as inventories that were drawn down as a
result of the U.S. CARS program were rebuilt. These factors should lead to a
temporary surge in automotive exports (Technical Box 2). Recent data

"suggest, however, that imports increased even more sharply in the quarter,"
so that the trade balance continued to subtract from growth. Business invest-
"ment is also expected to have fallen further, given ongoing uncertainty about"
the strength of the global recovery. Firms are expected to have continued
"drawing down inventories, although by a lesser amount than in the second"

a decline in the stock-to-sales ratio.

The Role of the Automotive Sector in the Recession and the Recovery
The automotive industry is playing a disproportion-
ately large role in the quarterly dynamics of Canadian
GDP this year (Chart 2-A).
1 In the ﬁ
"rst half of 2009,"
Canadian automotive production plummeted as a
result of the restructuring of the North American auto
sector and the ongoing decline in motor vehicle sales
in the United States. About three-quarters of all
""
vehicles produced in Canada are exported to the
United States. Owing to the importance of automotive
"products in Canadian exports, the latter contracted"
sharply in the ﬁ
"rst two quarters of 2009, declining by"
"30.4 per cent and 19.3 per cent (at annual rates),"
respectively. The partial resumption of automotive
production in the third quarter is expected to provide
"a large, albeit temporary, boost to growth in both"
exports and GDP.
"Thereafter, Canadian production of motor vehicles"
and parts is expected to increase gradually. A small
econometric model estimated by Bank staff suggests
that Canadian motor vehicle production will be
roughly 2.2 million units by 2012. Although this repre-
sents an 80 per cent increase from the level expected
"to be achieved in 2009, it is nonetheless well below"
its pre-crisis average of about 2.6 million units.
"Indeed, it is expected that motor vehicle sales in the"
"U.S. market will remain low over the next few years,"
"relative to pre-crisis levels, as U.S. households"
restore their balance sheets.
1 The automotive industry accounted for about 1.5 per cent of Canadian GDP in 2008.
assumed in April remains appropriate. The growth of potential output is
"expected to trough at 1.2 per cent in 2009, and then to gradually pick up to"
1.5 per cent in 2010 and 1.9 per cent in 2011 (Technical Box 3). It is impor-
tant to note that considerable uncertainty surrounds estimates of potential
"output, especially when the economy is coming out of a deep recession."
Estimated Pressures on Capacity
There continued to be a substantial amount of excess supply in the Canadian
economy in the third quarter. The Bank’s conventional measure of the output
gap was roughly unchanged at -4 per cent (Chart 14). In assessing excess
"capacity, the Bank considers its conventional measure in conjunction with"
"several other indicators, particularly since this measure tends to have a high"
margin of error around turning points. The Bank’s autumn Business Outlook
Survey (<http://www.bankofcanada.ca/en/bos/2009/autumn/bos1009e.pdf>) reported
that the percentage of ﬁ
rms that would have difﬁ
culty meeting an unantici-
pated increase in demand fell to its lowest level since the series began in 1999.
The growth of potential output is
expected to trough at 1.2 per cent in
"2009, and then pick up to 1.5 per cent"
in 2010 and 1.9 per cent in 2011.

Technical Box 3
Revisions to Potential Output
ﬁ
nancial crisis is expected to boost labour supply
slightly over 2009–10. Since both of these effects are
"assumed to be temporary, the growth rate of trend"
labour input is slightly slower in 2011 than projected
in October 2008.
These proﬁ
les for the growth of trend labour produc-
tivity and trend labour input imply growth rates for
"potential output growth of 1.2 per cent in 2009, 1.5 per"
"cent in 2010, and 1.9 per cent in 2011."
1 This path for
potential output is the same as in the April Report.
"Beyond 2011, the impact of restructuring is expected"
"to diminish, helping to boost the growth of total factor"
"productivity. This, combined with a pickup in capital"
"deepening as investment growth strengthens, will"
raise trend labour productivity growth to 1.2 per cent
"by 2012, its longer-run average. By contrast, the"
growth of labour input is expected to slow as the
effects of an aging population begin to weigh more
"heavily. As a result, potential output is assumed to"
grow by 1.9 per cent in 2012.
"Each October, the Bank reassesses the path for"
potential output that underpins its economic outlook.
Potential output is the level of goods and services
that the economy can produce on a sustained basis
without adding to inﬂ
ation pressures. It can be
thought of as the product of trend labour productivity
and trend labour input.
Trend labour productivity is related mainly to the
amount of capital per worker and the pace of tech-
nological change. The recession has reduced the
"capital-to-labour ratio, at least over the short term, by"
reducing investment below its trend and accelerating
structural change in the economy. Structural change
"is a normal feature of any economy, but recessions"
typically bring some of these changes forward and
concentrate them into a shorter time period. In 2008
and in the ﬁ
"rst half of 2009, many sectors of the"
economy—most notably the automotive and forestry
sectors—underwent signiﬁ
cant adjustment. These
changes included the permanent removal of some
production capital. Much of this capital will eventually
be reallocated to other ﬁ
"rms, but the process will take"
time. There will also be adjustment costs as labour is
gradually redeployed to other activities. With all of
"these developments taken into account, as well as"
the generally poor track record of labour productivity
"growth over the past several years, the Bank’s"
working hypothesis is that trend labour productivity
will decline by 0.2 per cent this year and then rise by
0.2 per cent in 2010 and by 0.9 per cent in 2011
(Table 3-A).
The growth rate of trend labour input is expected to
"decrease gradually over the next few years, largely"
reﬂ
ecting a decline in the growth rate of the working-
age population. Trend average hours worked are
"expected to be broadly stable, while the trend"
employment ratio is expected to fall only slightly.
"Taken together, this implies a growth rate of trend"
"labour input of 1.4 per cent in 2009, 1.3 per cent in"
"2010, and 1.0 per cent in 2011. The expected growth"
rates for trend labour input are about 0.1 percentage
point higher in 2009 and 2010 than assumed in the
October 2008 Report. This small upward revision
reﬂ
ects two factors: The working-age population has
expanded a little more quickly in the past year than
"anticipated, and the wealth destruction from the"

THE CANADIAN ECONOMY
BANK OF CANADA    MONETARY POLICY REPORT    OCTOBER 2009
18
Recent indicators suggest that the labour market may have stopped deterio-
"rating, consistent with excess supply reaching its peak level. Employment"
"and average hours worked have picked up in recent months, and the unem-"
ployment rate edged back down to 8.4 per cent in September. Weakness in
the private sector labour market is nonetheless evident in the Bank’s autumn
"Business Outlook Survey, in which the percentage of ﬁ"
rms reporting labour
"shortages remained largely unchanged at a very low level. As well, wage"
growth—as measured by average hourly earnings of permanent workers—
has recently decelerated.
After reviewing all the indicators of capacity pressures and taking into
account the weakness in potential output associated with the ongoing
"restructuring in the Canadian economy, the Bank judges that the economy"
was operating about 3 1/2 per cent below its production capacity in the third
"quarter of 2009, in line with the July projection."
Inﬂ
ation and the 2 Per Cent Target
Total CPI inﬂ
"ation continued to decline in the third quarter of 2009, as"
""
anticipated in the July Report. The 12-month rate of change in total CPI
"troughed at -0.9 per cent in the quarter, as a result of large year-over-year"
declines in energy prices (Chart 15). Core inﬂ
ation fell from 1.9 per cent in
"June to 1.5 per cent in September, owing to the substantial excess supply in"
the economy and the continued deceleration in core food price inﬂ
ation.
Measures of inﬂ
ation expectations have been stable in recent months. Near-
term inﬂ
"ation expectations remain at very low levels, in line with past move-"
ments in energy prices. The latest Consensus Economics forecasts for 2010
and beyond remain close to the 2 per cent inﬂ
ation target. The Bank’s most
recent Business Outlook Survey also showed that inﬂ
ation expectations are
concentrated within the Bank’s inﬂ
ation-control target range.
The Bank judges that the economy was
operating about 3 1/2 per cent below its
production capacity in the third quarter.
Total CPI inﬂ
ation troughed at -0.9 per
cent in the third quarter. Core inﬂ

the continued brisk pace in its growth (Chart 17). The strength in household
credit is linked to the rebound in the housing market and the pickup in reno-
vation activity.
"In contrast to household credit, business credit has been very weak recently,"
registering a modest decline in the three months to August. This sluggishness
in business credit mainly reﬂ
"ects the weak outlook for business investment,"
although the availability of credit has likely also played a role. For larger
""
"corporations, the situation has improved over the past few months, as indi-"
"cated, for instance, by the strong issuance activity in the Canadian corporate"
bond market. Borrowing costs for Canadian businesses have fallen further in
recent months. The effective average interest rate on business borrowing has
"declined by about 15 basis points since the July Report, mainly as a result of"
"the drop in corporate bond rates. Taken together, results from the Bank’s"
latest Senior Loan Ofﬁ
cer Survey (SLOS) (<http://www.bankofcanada.ca/en/slos/pdf/
slos2009Q3.pdf>) and the Business Outlook Survey indicate that credit condi-
"tions for businesses were little changed in the third quarter, following a period"
of substantial tightening (Chart 18).
The Bank’s ﬁ
nancial conditions index (FCI) has continued to improve since
the July Report and is now well above its 10-year average. The level of the
FCI reﬂ
"ects the exceptionally low level of the Bank’s policy rate, which is"
offsetting spreads on corporate bonds that are still above the average for the
"decade, despite their recent compression. It is worth noting that because the"
"exchange rate enters the FCI with a lag, it is not yet capturing the apprecia-"
"tion of the Canadian dollar since the spring. As well, the FCI assigns a very"
low weight to the SLOS measure of overall business-lending conditions. For
"these reasons, the Bank judges that the FCI currently overstates the improve-"
ment in ﬁ
nancial conditions.
The monetary aggregates have continued to grow strongly. In the three
"months to August, the narrow aggregate M1+ grew at an annual rate of"

THE CANADIAN ECONOMY
BANK OF CANADA    MONETARY POLICY REPORT    OCTOBER 2009
22
Exchange Rate
"The Canadian dollar remained relatively stable from July to early October,"
"trading in a range of 90 to 94 cents U.S. More recently, however, it has appre-"
"ciated sharply, averaging about 96 cents U.S. in the past 10 days, much"
higher than the 87 cents U.S. assumed at the time of the July Report
"(Chart 19). While higher commodity prices have been supportive, move-"
ments in the Canadian dollar over the period appear to have been increas-
ingly driven by a broader depreciation of the U.S. dollar against most major
currencies.
Policy Response
Monetary policy in Canada has continued to be exceptionally stimulative. On
"10 September and 20 October, the Bank of Canada maintained its target for"
the overnight interest rate at 1/4 per cent—the effective lower bound for this
rate—and reafﬁ
"rmed its commitment, conditional on the inﬂ"
"ation outlook, to"
hold the policy rate at that level until the end of the second quarter of 2010.
Outlook for the Canadian Economy
The Bank’s base-case projection incorporates the following key assumptions:
a Canada/U.S. exchange rate averaging 96 cents U.S.; energy prices in line
with recent futures prices; prices for non-energy commodities increasing
progressively as the global economy recovers; and global credit conditions
continuing to gradually improve.
Aggregate Demand and Supply
"Overall, the outlook for Canadian GDP growth is similar to that presented in"
the July Report (Table 3). The Bank now projects that growth will be slightly
"stronger in the second half of 2009 than expected in July (Chart 20). In part,"
this more favourable near-term outlook reﬂ
"ects temporary factors, such as"
the rebound in auto production and pent-up demand for housing. On an
"average annual basis, the economy is projected to contract by 2.4 per cent"
The Canadian dollar has appreciated
sharply since the July Report.

The recovery of the Canadian economy is expected to be supported by a
"number of domestic factors—notably, the substantial amount of monetary"
and ﬁ
"scal stimulus, the recent increase in household wealth, and our well-"
functioning ﬁ
nancial system. It also hinges on the resumption of growth in the
global economy and the associated ﬁ
"rming of commodity prices, which will"
"provide support to both domestic demand and exports. However, the high"
value of the Canadian dollar will act as a drag on demand for Canadian
"2 The annual growth rate projected for 2009 is slightly lower than in July, owing to downward revisions in real GDP data for the"

"rst quarter, which more than offset the slightly stronger growth projected for the second half of the year."
The economy is projected to contract
by 2.4 per cent this year and to grow
by 3.0 per cent in 2010 and 3.3 per cent
in 2011.

"products. Overall, the recovery in Canada is projected to be"
somewhat more
modest than the average of previous cycles (Chart 21).
Consumer spending is expected to grow at a solid pace throughout the
""
"projection horizon. In the near term, improvements in wealth and in consumer"
conﬁ
"dence, as well as the re-emergence of demand postponed from pre-"
"vious quarters, will help to fuel spending. As these effects diminish, growth in"
consumer spending should be supported by the recovery in the growth of
labour income. Growth in housing investment is projected to be brisk until
"early 2010, and then to slow down as the effects of temporary factors—such"
as pent-up demand and the home renovation tax credit—subside and afford-
"ability declines. In the wake of a short, severe recession, and with residual"
"economic uncertainty, the personal savings rate remains elevated over the"
projection horizon.
Business ﬁ
"xed investment is projected to recover in early 2010, following ﬁ"
ve
"quarters of contraction. As in past cycles, growth in business investment is"
"expected to lag the recovery, given the large amount of unused capacity, and"
then to rebound strongly once the recovery is well under way. The gradual
improvement in ﬁ
"nancial conditions and economic activity, as well as higher"
"commodity prices, should help to boost business spending. In light of recent"
"information, ﬁ"
rms are now expected to draw down their inventories at a
slower pace than in July.
"As detailed in the July Report, Canadian exporters should beneﬁ"
t dispropor-
"tionately from the U.S. recovery in 2010−11, since the projected growth in the"
Bank’s U.S. activity index is considerably higher than that in U.S. real GDP
over this period.
"3 The higher Canadian dollar will, however, dampen the"
expansion of exports. Import volumes are projected to increase at a solid
"pace, in line with the recovery in the domestic economy, the rebound in"
"exports, and the past appreciation of the Canadian dollar."

The core rate of inﬂ

"As noted earlier, total CPI inﬂ"

"rate, to -0.9 per cent in the third quarter of 2009, reﬂ"
ecting large year-over-
year drops in energy prices. With the base-year effects for gasoline prices
"dropping out of the data, this is expected to be the trough for total CPI inﬂ"

RISKS TO THE OUTLOOK
BANK OF CANADA    MONETARY POLICY REPORT    OCTOBER 2009 27
"The risks to the outlook remain elevated, although they have diminished"
"somewhat since the July Report, with accumulating evidence of a recovery in"
the global and Canadian economies.
The main upside risks to inﬂ
ation relate to the possibility of a stronger-than-
anticipated recovery in the global economy. The recovery is projected to be
"more subdued than usual, since complex processes of deleveraging and real"
adjustment are yet to be completed in the aftermath of the ﬁ
nancial crisis. It is
"possible, however, that the global recovery will be more vigorous than"
expected—in view of the extraordinary degree of monetary and ﬁ
scal stim-
ulus in most advanced countries and in line with the historical tendency for a
steeper downturn to be followed by a steeper recovery. A stronger global
"recovery would be transmitted to Canada via trade, ﬁ"
"nancial, conﬁ"
"dence, and"
commodity-price channels. There is also the risk that Canadian domestic
demand could be more robust and have a more sustained momentum than
"projected. In particular, Canadian households may increase their spending on"
consumption and residential investment more strongly than projected as the
"recovery takes hold. Both globally and in Canada, wealth effects stemming"
from sustained improvements in ﬁ
nancial conditions may add increased
impetus to the recovery.
"On the downside, a stronger-than-assumed Canadian dollar, driven by global"
"portfolio movements out of U.S.-dollar assets, could act as a signiﬁ"
cant further
drag on growth and put additional downward pressure on inﬂ
ation. Another
important downside risk to the inﬂ
ation outlook is that the global recovery could
"be even more protracted than projected. Up to this point, the recovery has"
been supported by aggressive monetary and ﬁ
scal stimulus across all G-20
"countries. Self-sustaining growth in private demand, which will be required for"
"a solid recovery, may take longer than expected to materialize."
While the Bank judges that these underlying macroeconomic risks to the pro-
"jection are roughly balanced, the overall risks to the inﬂ"
ation projection are tilted
slightly to the downside as a result of monetary policy operating at the effective
lower bound. The reason for this tilt is that the Bank could respond with con-
ventional monetary tightening in the event that upside risks materialized. In
"contrast, if downside risks materialized, the Bank would have to implement"
"unconventional policies, for which greater prudence would be warranted."
"Over the medium term, global macroeconomic imbalances continue to pose"
signiﬁ
cant risks to the outlook. Current account imbalances have been
""
"attenuated during the recession, as U.S. households have curtailed their"
"spending, while in China, the stimulus package has boosted domestic"
"demand. However, in the absence of policies to bring about a sustained"
"rotation of global demand, these imbalances may widen again with the"
"recovery, carrying the risk of disorderly adjustments."
