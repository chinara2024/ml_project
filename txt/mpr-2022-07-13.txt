 ation-control strategy
Canada’s infl
 ation-control strategy
Infl
 ation targeting and the economy
 

The objective of Canada’s monetary policy is to promote the 
economic and fi
 nancial well-being of Canadians. Canada’s 
experience with infl
 ation targeting since 1991 has shown that the 
best way that monetary policy can achieve this goal is by maintaining 
a low and stable infl
 ation environment. Doing so fosters confi
 dence 
in the value of money and contributes to sustained economic growth, 
a strong and inclusive labour market and improved living standards.
 

In 2021, the Government of Canada and the Bank of Canada 
renewed the fl
 exible infl
 ation-targeting strategy of the monetary policy 
framework for a further fi
 ve-year period, ending December 31, 2026.1 
 

The infl
 ation target was renewed at the 2% midpoint of the 1%–3% 
control range, with infl
 ation measured as the 12-month rate of 
change in the consumer price index (CPI). 
 

The Government and the Bank agreed that the best contribution 
monetary policy can make to the economic and fi
 nancial 
well-being of Canadians is to continue to focus on price stability. 
The Government and the Bank also agreed that monetary policy 
should continue to support maximum sustainable employment, 
recognizing that maximum sustainable employment is not directly 
measurable and is determined largely by non-monetary factors 
that can change through time. 
 

Further, the Government and the Bank agreed that because well-
anchored infl
 ation expectations are critical to achieving both price 
stability and maximum sustainable employment, the primary objective 
of monetary policy is to maintain low, stable infl
 ation over time. 
Infl
 ation targeting is symmetric and ﬂ
 exible
 

Canada’s infl
 ation-targeting approach is symmetric, which means 
the Bank is equally concerned about infl
 ation rising above or falling 
below the 2% target. 
 

Canada’s infl
 ation-targeting approach is also ﬂ
 exible. Typically, 
the Bank seeks to return infl
 ation to target over a horizon of six to 
eight quarters. However, the most appropriate horizon for returning 
infl
 ation to target will vary depending on the nature and persistence 
of the shocks buffeting the economy.
 

The 2021 agreement with the Government specifi
 es that the 2% 
infl
 ation target remains the cornerstone of the framework. 
 

The agreement further notes that the Bank will continue to use the 
fl
 exibility of the 1%–3% control range to actively seek the maximum 
sustainable level of employment, when conditions warrant. The Bank 
will also continue to leverage the fl
 exibility inherent in the framework 
to help address the challenges of structurally low interest rates by 
using a broad set of policy tools. The Bank will use this fl
 exibility only 
to an extent that is consistent with keeping medium-term infl
 ation 
expectations well anchored at 2%.
Monetary policy tools
 

Because monetary policy actions take time to work their way through 
the economy and have their full effect on infl
 ation, monetary policy 
must be forward-looking.
 

The Bank normally carries out monetary policy through changes 
in the target for the overnight rate of interest (the policy rate). The 
Bank also has a range of monetary policy tools it can use when the 
policy rate is at very low levels. These tools consist of guidance on 
the future evolution of the policy rate, large-scale asset purchases 
(quantitative easing and credit easing), funding for credit measures, 
and negative policy rates. The potential use and sequencing of these 
tools would depend on the economic and fi
 nancial market context.
 

All of the Bank’s monetary policy tools affect total demand for 
Canadian goods and services through their infl
 uence on market 
interest rates, domestic asset prices and the exchange rate. The 
balance between this demand and the economy’s production 
capacity is, over time, the main factor that determines infl
 ation 
pressures in the economy.
Communications
 

Consistent with its commitment to clear, transparent communications, 
the Bank regularly reports its perspectives on the economy and 
infl
 ation. Policy decisions are typically announced on eight pre-set 
days during the year, and full updates of the Bank’s outlook are 
published four times each year in the Monetary Policy Report.
 

The Bank is committed to explaining when it is using the fl
 exibility of 
the infl
 ation-targeting strategy.
 

Given the uncertainty about the maximum sustainable level of 
employment, the Bank will consider a broad range of labour market 
indicators.2 The Bank will also systematically report to Canadians on 
how labour market outcomes have factored into its policy decisions.
Monitoring infl
 ation
 

In the short run, the prices of certain CPI components can be 
particularly volatile and can cause sizable fl
 uctuations in CPI infl
 ation.
 

In setting monetary policy, the Bank seeks to look through such 
transitory movements in CPI infl
 ation and focuses on a set of “core” 
infl
 ation measures that better refl
 ect the underlying trend of infl
 ation. 
In this sense, these measures act as an operational guide to help the 
Bank achieve the CPI infl
 ation target. They are not a replacement for 
CPI infl
 ation.
 

The Bank’s three preferred measures of core infl
 ation are CPI-trim, 
which excludes CPI components whose rates of change in a given 
month are the most extreme; CPI-median, which corresponds to 
the price change located at the 50th percentile (in terms of basket 
weight) of the distribution of price changes; and CPI-common, which 
uses a statistical procedure to track common price changes across 
categories in the CPI basket.

Overview 
Overview 
Inflation around the world has continued to rise quickly, largely due to 
increases in the prices for energy and food. Global supply chain challenges 
have also persisted, and when combined with strong demand, this has led to 
a broadening in price pressures. 
Global growth is slowing due to Russia’s aggression in Ukraine and 
continued supply chain disruptions. As well, high inflation and monetary 
policy tightening in many countries are beginning to moderate demand.
With the removal of most public health restrictions in Canada, economic 
activity in hard-to-distance service sectors has rebounded strongly. With 
the rest of the economy already more than fully recovered, the Canadian 
economy is now clearly in excess demand. While high inflation in Canada 
is largely the result of international factors, domestic demand pressures are 
becoming more prominent, and price pressures have broadened. 
In response to high inflation and rising inflation expectations, the Bank of 
Canada is raising interest rates. This will temper borrowing and spending, 
slow demand growth, help anchor inflation expectations and ultimately 
reduce inflationary pressures. 
Key messages
	
 Inflation continues to rise, and price pressures are broadening. Consumer 
price index (CPI) inflation will average close to 8% in the middle quarters of 
2022. Survey responses show that consumer and business expectations 
about inflation over the next two years have moved higher. 
	
 The Canadian economy is overheated, and labour markets are tight. The 
unemployment rate is at a series low, and elevated job vacancies and 
widespread labour shortages are pushing up wage growth. With strong 
demand for their products, businesses are passing through higher input 
and labour costs to consumer prices.
	
 With global growth moderating and higher interest rates dampening 
domestic spending, growth in Canada is projected to slow from 3½% in 
2022 to 1¾% in 2023 and 2½% in 2024. This allows supply to catch up 
with demand, reducing domestic inflationary pressures.
	
 Domestic price pressures are expected to abate, global supply chain 
problems are anticipated to resolve gradually, and energy prices are 
projected to decline. Inflation in Canada is anticipated to decrease to roughly 
3% by the end of 2023 and return to the 2% target by the end of 2024.
	
 The Bank is guarding against the risk that high inflation becomes 
entrenched because if it does, restoring price stability will require even 
higher interest rates, leading to a weaker economy.

Global economy
Global economy
The global economy is facing multiple headwinds. Inflation is high worldwide 
and continues to increase, largely due to surging energy and food prices. 
Supply challenges are contributing to inflationary pressures as demand is 
recovering from the pandemic. Global economic activity is estimated to have 
declined in the second quarter of 2022 because of the war in Ukraine and 
the lockdown of some major cities in China to limit the spread of COVID-19. 
Growth in US private domestic demand is also estimated to have slowed 
sharply. Many central banks are tightening monetary policy to combat 
increasingly broad-based inflationary pressures. As a result, financial 
conditions have tightened, and this is weighing on global growth. 
Growth should rebound in the third quarter as restrictions ease in China, but 
higher interest rates and the war in Ukraine will continue to restrain activity. 
The Bank projects global growth to moderate to about 3¼% in 2022 and 2% 
in 2023—a slower pace than projected in the April Report mostly because 
of tighter monetary policy (Table 1 and Box 1). Global growth is expected to 
strengthen to 3% in 2024 once the war’s impact on growth subsides.

Still-elevated energy prices
Energy prices remain volatile (Chart 1). Since the April Report, Brent crude 
oil prices have fluctuated between about US$100 and US$125 per barrel. Oil 
prices fell in early May due to reduced demand from China in the wake of 
COVID-19 containment measures. Supply concerns, including the European 
Union’s ban on Russian oil imports, subsequently pushed prices up. Over the 
past month, prices have fallen due to concerns about a significant slowdown 
in global growth. 
Prices of natural gas have also been volatile. While they remain high in 
Europe and Asia due to concerns about Russia’s supply of natural gas, prices 
fell recently in North America. Prices of refined products, such as gasoline 
and diesel, are disproportionally higher than oil prices because of low 
inventories and reduced refining capacity as well as war-related disruptions. 
Looking ahead, Brent oil prices are assumed to fall slowly to US$100 by the 
end of 2024 (Box 2). Prices for West Texas Intermediate (WTI) and Western 
Canadian Select (WCS) are assumed to follow similar patterns, remaining 
Box 1
Changes to the economic projection since the April Report 
Global GDP outlook
Projected growth in global gross domestic product 
(GDP) has been revised down signifi
 cantly since the 
April Report. It is reduced by about ¼ of a percentage 
point in 2022, ½ a percentage point in 2023 and ¼ of a 
percentage point in 2024. Overall, the level of GDP at 
the end of 2024 is roughly ¾% lower. 
The following factors explain the downward revisions to 
the outlook: 
 
 Given the stronger-than-expected infl
 ation, monetary 
policy is now expected to be tighter over the 
projection horizon in both advanced and emerging-
market economies. As well, credit conditions 
tightened more than anticipated. 
 
 Government spending in the United States 
is weaker, partly due to a slower rollout of 
infrastructure spending.
 
 China’s growth forecast for 2022 is lower because 
COVID-19 containment measures affecting major 
cities have lasted longer than anticipated.
Canadian GDP outlook
GDP growth in 2022 and 2023 has been revised down 
signifi
 cantly to 3½% and 1¾%, respectively. The forecast 
for growth has been lowered by about ¾ of a percentage 
point in 2022 and by about 1½ percentage points in 
2023. Growth in 2024 has been revised up by ¼ of a 
percentage point to 2½%. These revisions leave the level 
of real GDP about 1¾% lower in 2024.
The following key factors contribute to the reduced GDP 
profi
 le:
 
 Supply has been revised down over the projection 
horizon (see Box 2).
 
 Infl
 ation is higher, fi
 nancial conditions are tighter, 
and household wealth is lower. As a result, the 
outlook for household expenditures has been 
revised down over the projection horizon.
 
 The effects of supply chain disruptions on economic 
activity—notably in the manufacturing sector—are 
lasting longer than expected.
 
 Foreign demand has been revised down in 2023 and 
2024 partly due to tighter global fi
 nancial conditions, 
leading to lower exports and business investment. 
Canadian CPI infl
 ation outlook
Consumer price index (CPI) infl
 ation is anticipated to 
be substantially higher than projected in April. The 
outlook for CPI infl
 ation has been revised up by almost 
2 percentage points to 7.2% in 2022, by 1.8 percentage 
points to 4.6% in 2023, and by 0.2 percentage points 
to 2.3% in 2024. These revisions mainly refl
 ect more 
persistent and broad-based infl
 ationary pressures 
than previously estimated. They also refl
 ect higher 
commodity prices and wider-than-usual gasoline 
refi
 nery margins as well as rising infl
 ation expectations. 
In addition, higher estimates of excess demand in 2022 
raise the infl
 ation forecast in 2022 and into 2023.

US$5 and US$20 below Brent prices, respectively. With this outlook, the 
Bank assumes that the impact of war-related factors on oil prices diminishes 
gradually. 
Risks around the outlook for oil prices are two-sided. Russia may face 
additional sanctions for its invasion of Ukraine that could further reduce 
Russian oil production. This would put more upward pressure on oil prices. 
In contrast, price pressures could be lower if the war-related uncertainty 
dissipates faster than expected or if Russia exports more of its oil to Asia.
Since the April Report, the Bank’s non-energy commodity price index has 
fallen by roughly 15%. Prices for base metals have declined sharply because 
of concerns about global demand, particularly demand from China. Lumber 
prices also fell abruptly due to weakening housing activity in North America. 
Prices of agricultural products have declined, reflecting favourable weather 
that is boosting harvest prospects. Even with the recent decline, prices for 
most non-energy commodities are still likely to stay above their pre-pandemic 
levels over the projection horizon.
High and widespread inflation globally
Inflation is high and becoming more broad-based across goods and services 
in most regions. Short-term inflation expectations are elevated in many 
countries. Surging energy and food prices remain key contributors to inflation. 
Elevated demand is leading to a broadening of inflationary pressures, 
allowing high energy prices to pass through to other prices.

Box 2
Key inputs to the projection
The Bank of Canada’s projection is always conditional 
on several key assumptions, and changes to these will 
affect the outlook for the Canadian economy. The Bank 
regularly reviews these assumptions and how they may 
impact the economic projection. The key inputs into the 
Bank’s projection are as follows:
 
 Public health restrictions have largely been removed 
in many countries. It is assumed that remaining 
measures will be lifted over the course of 2022 in 
most of the world. Containment measures in China, 
however, are expected to loosen more gradually—
and even periodically tighten—over 2022 and 2023.
 
 In Canada, most public health restrictions have been 
lifted. Pandemic-related effects on consumer caution 
and travel are assumed to continue to fade over the 
projection horizon.
 
 The projection incorporates information from all 
available provincial and federal budgets.
 
 Oil prices are assumed to gradually decrease over 
the projection horizon from their current elevated 
levels. The price of Brent stays near US$115 per 
barrel for the third quarter of 2022 and then declines 
to about US$100 by the end of 2024. The prices 
for West Texas Intermediate (WTI) and Western 
Canadian Select (WCS) follow similar dynamics, 
with a constant spread below the price for Brent of 
US$5 and US$20, respectively. Brent and WTI oil 
prices are about US$10 above the level assumed in 
the April Report. The spread between WTI and WCS 
is US$5 wider than assumed in the April Report, 
refl
 ecting a broad-based rise in the premium of light 
oil over heavy oil.
 
 By convention, the Bank does not forecast the 
exchange rate in the Monetary Policy Report. 
The Canadian dollar is assumed to remain at 
78 cents US over the projection horizon, close to its 
recent average and slightly below the 79 cents US 
assumed in the April Report.
 
 The pandemic is having both temporary and lasting 
effects on the supply side of the Canadian economy. 
As in recent reports, the Bank distinguishes between 
supply and potential output to account for the 
episodic nature of some supply decreases that are 
caused by pandemic-related factors, such as public 
health measures and supply chain disruptions.
 

The Bank’s assessment of potential output, a 
longer-term concept, looks through the short-
lived effects of factors related to the pandemic. 
As in the April Report, potential output growth 
(excluding temporary factors) is expected to 
average about 2% per year over 2022–24.
 

The projection assumes that short-term factors, 
such as supply chain disruptions, are reducing 
the supply of goods and services. These factors 
are assumed to have a maximum negative 
impact of about 2½% on the level of supply in 
the second and third quarters of 2022. This 
effect is expected to start decreasing in the 
fourth quarter and to dissipate beyond the 
projection horizon. Both the magnitude and the 
persistence of the effects of supply disruptions 
are larger than in the April Report. Supply 
chain disruptions are estimated to have larger 
and longer-lasting implications for business 
operations than previously assumed.
 

Estimates of overall growth in supply can be 
obtained by combining the estimates of the 
temporary effects of these short-term factors 
with the assessment of potential output. Supply 
growth is projected to be around ¾
  % in 2022 
and to average roughly 2¾
  % over 2023–24. 
 
 Gross domestic product (GDP) is estimated to 
have grown at a stronger-than-potential pace in 
the second quarter of 2022 amid supply chain 
disruptions. As a result, the Bank estimates that 
the output gap—the difference between GDP and 
supply—was between 0.5% and 1.5% in the second 
quarter. This is further into positive territory than the 
estimate of -0.25% to 0.75% for the fi
 rst quarter of 
2022.
 
 The nominal neutral policy interest rate is defi
 ned as 
the real neutral rate plus 2% for infl
 ation. The real 
neutral rate is defi
 ned as the rate consistent with 
both output remaining sustainably at its potential and 
infl
 ation remaining at target, on an ongoing basis. It 
is a medium- to long-term equilibrium concept. For 
Canada, the projection is based on the assumption 
that the nominal neutral rate is at the midpoint of the 
estimated range of 2% to 3%. This range was last 
reassessed in the April 2022 Report.

BANK OF CANADA  •  Monetary Policy Report  •  July 2022
Widespread supply shortages continue to be an important source of global 
inflationary pressure. While shipping costs have moderated and supplier 
delivery times have improved slightly in recent months (Chart 2), lockdowns 
in China and the war in Ukraine have caused new supply disruptions. The 
Bank assumes that global supply challenges will ease over the next year.
Inflation is projected to rise further and to peak in most regions in the third 
quarter of this year. It is expected to gradually decline thereafter because, 
in the projection, the effects of past increases in energy and food prices 
dissipate, energy prices decline, supply challenges ease, and demand slows. 
Tighter global financial conditions 
Global financial conditions are more restrictive than in the April Report. 
Equity prices have declined, and corporate bond spreads have widened 
(Chart 3). Global government bond yields have experienced significant 
volatility since the April Report. They initially rose as central banks in 
advanced and emerging economies continued to tighten monetary policy. 
Yields on longer-term government bonds have retreated somewhat over the 
past few weeks due to concerns about the prospects for global growth but 
remain higher than in April. The Canadian dollar depreciated against the 
US dollar, although less so than most other currencies.

Sharp slowdown after robust growth in the 
United States
The US economy is in excess demand, and the labour market is tight. Job 
openings are near record levels, and the unemployment rate is close to a 
40-year low. Wage growth has been rising rapidly over the past year, though 
not by enough to keep up with inflation. However, consumption and housing 
activity have weakened considerably in recent months as high inflation and 
the rising path of interest rates reduce demand. 
To combat high inflation, the Federal Reserve has increased the target range 
for the federal funds rate by 150 basis points since the start of 2022. In June, 
the Federal Reserve also started reducing the size of its balance sheet—a 
process known as quantitative tightening. 
The US economy is on track to grow by about 2% in 2022, supported by the 
ongoing recovery and households spending their previously accumulated 
savings. Consumption and business investment are expected to slow as 
higher interest rates work their way through the economy. GDP growth in the 
United States is anticipated to moderate to about 1% in 2023 and in 2024.
War disruptions and rising inflation in the euro area
The war in Ukraine and associated uncertainty are weighing heavily on 
the euro area economy. Surging energy prices and trade disruptions are 
dampening production. High inflation is eroding household purchasing power 
and hurting consumer confidence. In response to elevated inflation, the 
European Central Bank ended its net asset purchases and announced plans to 
raise its policy rates in the coming months. Overall, growth is projected to slow 
from 2¾% in 2022 to 1% in 2023. Growth is expected to pick up in 2024 as the 
effects of the war and elevated energy prices fade.

Lockdowns in China 
China’s economy likely contracted in the second quarter because of strict 
measures to contain outbreaks of COVID-19. Lockdowns in important 
manufacturing and trading hubs temporarily hampered production and 
trade and have compounded challenges with global supply chains. Mobility 
restrictions and the ongoing correction in the property sector are weighing on 
domestic demand. 
Authorities have introduced several policies to stimulate growth, including 
additional infrastructure spending, targeted tax cuts and lower mortgage 
rates. China’s economy should rebound in the third quarter of 2022 because 
of this policy stimulus and the recent easing of lockdown measures. 
Uncertainty about the growth outlook remains high, given the fragility of the 
property sector and the risk of even more intense lockdowns if another wave 
of COVID-19 occurs.
Multiple headwinds in emerging-market economies 
The war in Ukraine, high energy prices and, to a lesser extent, China’s 
lockdowns are hampering growth in oil-importing emerging-market 
economies (EMEs), particularly in Europe and Asia. The sharp tightening of 
financial conditions in many EMEs is also weighing on domestic demand. As 
a result, growth is expected to moderate in 2022 and 2023 before picking up 
in 2024 as the effects of these headwinds dissipate. 
Activity in the rest-of-the-world group is held back by tighter global financial 
conditions and by the sharp contraction of the Russian economy due to 
economic sanctions. However, other oil-exporting countries are expected to 
benefit from increased oil revenues.

Canadian economy
Canadian economy
Inflation continues to rise and broaden in Canada, reflecting widespread 
cost pressures. Global factors—including high prices for energy, food and 
tradable goods—are driving most of the surge. In addition, excess demand 
in the Canadian economy is playing a more significant role. It is making firms 
more likely to pass cost increases on to consumers, leading to a broadening 
of inflationary pressures.
Businesses and consumers increasingly think that inflation will be higher for 
longer, and they are more uncertain about the future path of inflation. This 
points to an increasing risk that elevated inflation will become entrenched.
CPI inflation is forecast to average around 8% in the middle quarters of 2022. 
It is then projected to ease to roughly 3% by the end of 2023 and return to 
target by the end of 2024. Inflation declines as the impact of higher energy 
prices dissipates, supply challenges recede, and monetary policy in Canada 
and abroad reduces domestic and foreign demand. In this projection, inflation 
is considerably higher and more persistent than in the April Report (see 
Box 1 on page 3 and the Appendix on page 26).
Growth has been robust over the past year as the Canadian economy 
recovered from the worst effects of the pandemic. Strong housing markets, 
high commodity prices and the easing of public health restrictions have 
boosted economic activity. However, economic growth is now showing signs 
of slowing. The effects of higher prices and interest rates have begun to 
weigh on household spending. In particular, a sharp slowdown in the housing 
market is underway. 
Overall, economic growth is forecast to be strong in 2022 at about 3½% and 
to moderate to about 1¾% in 2023 and 2½% in 2024 (Table 2). Growth slows 
largely due to the impact of high inflation and tighter financial conditions on 
consumption and housing activity. A weaker outlook for global growth also 
weighs on exports and business investment. The Canadian growth outlook is 
revised down in 2022 and 2023 relative to the April Report.

CPI inflation at a 40-year high 
CPI inflation has continued to rise and is now expected to reach about 8% in 
the third quarter of 2022 (Chart 4). Global factors remain the largest drivers. 
These include Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which has further pushed up 
food and gasoline prices. As well, tradable goods prices, including high 
freight costs, continue to put pressure on global costs.

BANK OF CANADA  •  Monetary Policy Report  •  July 2022
Domestic demand conditions are also contributing to elevated inflation. The 
pandemic saw a profound shift in consumer preferences toward goods and 
low-contact services. In addition to the strength in goods prices, shelter 
prices, which include rent, have risen significantly over the past year. With 
the recent removal of health restrictions, prices for hard-to-distance services, 
such as traveller accommodations, have also been increasing. 
Overall, demand remains robust. It has enabled many firms to raise prices—
passing on to consumers higher costs, including the recent spike in energy 
prices. As a result, inflation has broadened, with almost three-quarters of 
CPI categories growing above 3% and more than half growing above 5% 
(Chart 5). 
Measures of core inflation have increased further since the April Report. CPI-
trim, CPI-median and CPI-common are at 5.4%, 4.9% and 3.9%, respectively. 
The rise in CPI-common—which puts more weight on services and domestic 
conditions—reflects growing excess demand in Canada.
Higher and more dispersed inflation expectations
Inflation expectations have a direct impact on inflation because they 
are factored in when firms set wages and prices. To assess inflation 
expectations, the Bank relies on various survey results and market-based 
information. Consumer and business surveys indicate that median inflation 
expectations over the next two years have increased (Chart 6). Inflation 
expectations of professional forecasters have also increased at the two-year 
horizon, albeit much more modestly than those of households and firms. 
Household and business surveys also show a wider distribution of inflation 
expectations among respondents. In particular, a large number of participants 
in the Business Outlook Survey (BOS) for the second quarter of 2022—
considerably more than in previous surveys—now think that inflation will be 
at or well above 4% over the next two years (Chart 7).1 These survey results 
suggest greater uncertainty about the future path of inflation, increasing the 
risk that inflation expectations become de-anchored.
1	 As well, the Canadian Survey of Consumer Expectations shows that the distribution among household 
survey respondents has also widened. However, the increase in dispersion for households is less 
clear-cut than that of businesses.

BANK OF CANADA  •  Monetary Policy Report  •  July 2022
Survey participants continue to point to global factors as the primary reason 
for higher expected inflation. However, they increasingly mention domestic 
factors, such as strong demand and persistent labour shortages. 
The surveys show that inflation expectations at longer horizons have increased 
but remain in line with their pre-pandemic levels. While BOS results indicate 
that businesses now think inflation will remain above 2% for longer, the majority 
of respondents still expect inflation to return to target within the next three 
years. Market-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are also in 
line with the Bank’s inflation target. The five-year break-even inflation rate has 
decreased recently to about 2¼%. At this level, it is consistent with a rise in 
inflation over the near term followed by a decline toward the 2% target.
Tighter financial conditions 
The Bank has tightened monetary policy in response to the strength of 
inflationary pressures, beginning to increase its policy rate in March and 
initiating quantitative tightening on April 25.2
Higher policy rates, market expectations of further rate increases, and 
quantitative tightening in Canada and elsewhere have contributed to rapid 
increases in borrowing costs for businesses and households (Chart 8). 
Households seeking to renew or take on a new mortgage now face five-
year fixed mortgage rates at their highest level since 2010. According to the 
Canadian Survey of Consumer Expectations for the second quarter of 2022, 
consumers expect that accessing credit 12 months from now will be more 
difficult.
2	 Under quantitative tightening, the Bank is shrinking its balance sheet by letting maturing bonds roll off. By 
July 8, the Bank’s holdings of Government of Canada bonds had declined from around $425 billion at the 
time of the last Report to about $400 billion, and settlement balances had dropped from around $230 billion 
to about $175 billion during the same period. Quantitative tightening complements the increase in the policy 
rate by reducing the degree of monetary stimulus. This occurs in a predictable way because information 
about the Bank’s holdings of maturing bonds is available to the public.

Slower growth in the third quarter  
Following several robust quarters, economic growth is expected to slow 
from about 4% in the second quarter to about 2% in the third (Table 3 and 
Chart 9). Consumption growth moderates as the boost from pent-up demand 
for in-person services eases. High inflation is also squeezing household 
budgets, and rising interest rates are increasing the cost to finance 
purchases of big-ticket items and making savings more attractive.

BANK OF CANADA  •  Monetary Policy Report  •  July 2022
Housing market activity is weakening substantially from its unsustainable 
pace during the pandemic (Chart 10). Resales are falling across most 
regions and prices are declining in some markets as borrowing rates rise and 
household confidence declines. Some areas outside downtown cores, which 
had previously seen large price increases, are now experiencing a decline in 
prices.3
Exports and business investment continue to grow strongly, with the latter 
expected to reach pre-pandemic levels in the third quarter. Recent strength 
in US industrial production and an easing of travel restrictions should provide 
support for exports over the near term. As well, elevated energy prices are 
boosting exports and investment in the energy sector as firms seek to make 
full use of existing production capacity. Near-term business investment is 
also supported by a ramping up of work at LNG Canada’s Kitimat site and 
continued work modernizing electric vehicle manufacturing.
Canadian economy in excess demand
A broad set of measures indicates that the economy is operating beyond its 
productive capacity. 
The labour market is tight along all dimensions.4 Most indicators suggest the 
labour market has surpassed maximum sustainable employment (Chart 11), 
including the unemployment rate, which is at a series low. In turn, labour 
shortages are pushing wages higher. In the BOS for the second quarter of 
2022, a near-record number of firms see labour shortages as more intense 
than they were a year ago. The ratios of vacancies and job postings to 
3	 The move to remote work in many sectors of the economy, combined with a desire for more living space, 
likely encouraged many households to seek properties away from downtown areas. For more details,

pandemic,” Bank of Canada Staff Analytical Note No. 2022-7 (June 2022).

unemployed workers have also risen to record levels. As a result of this 
tightness, wage growth is strengthening and broadening across sectors 
(Chart 12).  
Businesses continue to report capacity constraints, including labour 
shortages and supply chain challenges (Chart 13). Supply constraints are 
still weighing on production and sales. This is particularly acute in the auto 
sector, where it continues to be difficult to source semiconductors and get 
motor vehicles to retailers. 
The Bank estimates that the output gap—the difference between GDP and 
supply—has risen further into positive territory in the second quarter of 2022, 
to between 0.5% and 1.5%. This is up from the estimate of -0.25% to 0.75% 
for the first quarter (Box 2). With economic growth anticipated to be roughly 
in line with supply growth in the third quarter, the economy remains in excess 
demand.

BANK OF CANADA  •  Monetary Policy Report  •  July 2022
Slower demand coupled with pickup in supply 
The Canadian economy is anticipated to grow by about 3½% over 2022, 
boosted by pent-up domestic demand. Growth then slows to about 1¾% 
in 2023 in response to higher interest rates, lower commodity prices and 
declining foreign demand. Economic growth reaches 2½% in 2024 as 
household spending improves.
Supply growth is forecast to rebound from about ¾% in 2022 to about 2¾% 
on average over 2023–24. It strengthens over the projection horizon as global 
transportation bottlenecks and shortages of critical inputs ease. The easing 
of supply constraints, together with robust business investment, drives a 
rebound in productivity from its recent lows. Meanwhile, higher immigration 
will boost labour supply.
Excess demand in the Canadian economy eases over the projection horizon 
as demand moderates and supply strengthens. The output gap is expected 
to close in 2023 and move into modest excess supply in 2024.
Inflation lower in late 2022 and at target by the end of 
2024
Inflation is expected to decline over the projection horizon (Chart 14 and 
Chart 15). Inflation falls from about 8% in the third quarter of 2022 to roughly 
3% by the end of 2023. A decline in oil prices and lower house prices pull 
down quarter-over-quarter inflation in the second half of 2022. This helps lay 
the foundation for the decline in inflation. Inflation returns to the 2% target by 
the end of 2024 as global price pressures and domestic demand ease.

large imbalances in the housing market that have signifi
 cantly raised shelter costs, changes to the production 
network (e.g., reshoring) and greater pass-through from oil or import prices. Non-commodity import prices 
include the impact of the Can$/US$ exchange rate. Numbers may not add to total due to rounding.

Inflation is forecast to ease, reflecting several forces. Oil prices are projected 
to fall gradually, with the Brent price back down to $100 by the end of 2024. 
Global supply bottlenecks abate, and the tightening of monetary policy 
abroad weighs on foreign demand. Consequently, inflation of tradable goods 
prices declines. 
Higher interest rates in Canada will soften demand, reducing domestic 
inflationary pressures. Inflation of services prices, including shelter price 
inflation, eases. Considerable uncertainty continues to surround this outlook, 
as has been the case throughout the pandemic (see the Appendix on 
page 26). 
Sizable pullback in housing activity 
The contraction in housing activity is expected to continue in the second 
half of 2022 and into 2023. Resales and house prices decline as borrowing 
rates rise and the pandemic-induced boost in demand wanes. Residential 
construction, including renovations, is also predicted to drop over the 
next year. Housing activity and prices are forecast to stabilize later in the 
projection horizon as both population and income growth boost housing 
demand.

Softer consumption growth 
Consumption grows at a modest pace over the projection horizon. 
Spending on travel and other hard-to-distance services rises as consumers 
become less concerned about physical distancing. This will contribute to 
a rebalancing of the consumption of goods and services (Chart 16). A 
drawdown in some of the savings accumulated during the pandemic also 
supports household spending.5 For example, motor vehicle purchases are 
expected to pick up as supply shortages resolve and pent-up demand is met.
However, consumption growth is anticipated to slow from its current strong 
pace. High inflation means that households will allocate more of their 
disposable income to necessities such as food and gasoline, leaving them 
with less money to spend on other items. And higher interest rates mean that 
some households will postpone major purchases, pay down debt or save 
more.6 As well, some households—particularly those that took on a sizable 
mortgage when rates were lower—will face significantly larger payments 
when they renew their mortgages. The slowdown in housing activity will also 
weigh on the consumption of goods such as furniture and appliances. 
Moderate export growth
Export growth is expected to remain strong throughout the remainder of 2022, 
boosted by elevated commodity prices and a pickup in international travel. 
Later in the projection horizon, export growth slows as foreign demand declines 
(Chart 17).
Non-energy exports should grow solidly as global supply disruptions 
dissipate. However, exports of motor vehicles will slow growth in the 
second half of 2023 and in 2024 when some manufacturing facilities close 
temporarily to retool for the production of electric vehicles. Exports and 
imports of services strengthen and reach pre-pandemic levels in 2024 while 
international travel continues to recover.
5	 However, consumers are incentivized to save more than previously expected given increased 
uncertainty and higher interest rates offering better returns.
6	 These assessments are consistent with results from the Canadian Survey of Consumer Expectations—
Second Quarter 2022.

Energy exports are projected to grow strongly due to high prices and 
increased transportation capacity. Expected expansions in pipeline 
capacity—including the Trans Mountain Expansion project—and in volumes 
of crude-by-rail will support growth later in the projection horizon.
Imports are anticipated to remain solid, backed by robust business 
investment, ongoing restocking by businesses, and firms’ desire to hold more 
inventory to buffer themselves against future supply disruptions.
Robust business investment 
Outside the oil and gas sector, the investment outlook is bolstered by solid 
demand, robust business confidence and a push to alleviate capacity 
constraints (Chart 18). This outlook is consistent with the results of the BOS, 
with firms planning investments in digital technologies to improve productivity 
given tight labour markets and high input costs.  
Investment growth in the oil and gas sector is anticipated to be robust, 
though more muted than during past periods of high prices. Producers 
of conventional oil and natural gas are expected to focus on expanding 
production capacity in fields where infrastructure is readily available. 
Investment in the oil sands is expected to be limited to improving the use of 
existing capacity and expanding current projects. Oil sands projects tend to 
require more capital and emit higher levels of greenhouse gases, making 
them sensitive to uncertainty about long-term demand and the transition to a 
low-carbon economy.

Risks to the inflation outlook
Risks to the inflation outlook
The global economy faces many challenges. The pace of monetary policy 
tightening has accelerated in many countries as inflationary pressures have 
continued to rise and broaden. These pressures are contributing to greater 
volatility in financial markets and growing concerns about the path for the 
global recovery. Also, even as disruptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic 
have continued to ease, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine remains a major source 
of uncertainty. 
Some of the risks identified in previous reports have been partially 
incorporated into the projection. The base-case scenario includes more 
persistent supply challenges, greater pass-through of cost increases, tighter 
global financial conditions and the impact of higher inflation expectations.
The Bank sees two main risks to the outlook for inflation. On the upside, if 
left unchecked, persistently high inflation could result in a wage-price spiral. 
On the downside, the slowdown in the global economy could be more severe 
than expected, especially if the US economy slows more than expected. 
Drawing from a larger set of risks, this section discusses other risks that 
may affect the projected path of inflation. The upside risks are of greater 
concern because inflation is persistently high, and evidence is mounting that 
expectations of inflation are drifting upward.
(i)	
Main upside risk: Higher inflation becomes entrenched (↑)
Until inflation drops significantly, the risk is greater that Canadians will 
believe it will stay high over the long term. Higher inflation expectations 
could lead to more pervasive increases in prices and labour costs, 
and these in turn could become embedded in higher inflation. Box 3 
provides a scenario of what could happen if longer-term inflation 
expectations become de-anchored and a wage-price spiral takes 
hold. In this case, mutually reinforcing wage and price pressures 
would amplify high inflation, and a greater degree of monetary policy 
tightening and a more pronounced slowdown of the economy would be 
needed to bring inflation back to target. 
(ii)	
Main downside risk: More severe global slowdown (↓)
The global economy could slow more than anticipated. The euro 
area is at risk of recession as energy shortages lead to even higher 
prices, undermining consumer demand. Economy-wide disruptions 
could occur if rationing is implemented. At the same time, the impact 
of tighter financial conditions on household confidence and spending 
could be greater than expected. This could lead to slower growth in 
many regions. If more forceful actions are required to restrain inflation 
	
Risks to the inflation outlook	 23
 
	
BANK OF CANADA  •  Monetary Policy Report  •  July 2022
in the United States, US growth could slow more than projected. As 
well, lockdowns in China could be more frequent and have a larger 
negative impact on growth than currently assumed. These shocks 
would be transmitted to the Canadian economy through weaker foreign 
demand, lower commodity prices and a deterioration in the terms of 
trade.
Other risks
(iii)	 Stronger household spending in Canada (↑)
In the base-case scenario, consumption grows at a modest pace 
and housing activity sees a sizable pullback. For many households, 
higher inflation and interest rates are squeezing budgets. However, 
a considerable proportion of households have accumulated large 
excess savings and are therefore more capable of absorbing higher 
prices. With the reopening of the economy, the boost from pent-up 
demand could be more sustained than anticipated if this group spends 
even more of its accumulated savings. Consumption and residential 
investment would then be stronger than projected and would contribute 
to greater inflationary pressures.
(iv)	 Reversal of increases in goods prices (↓)
The base-case scenario assumes that the spike in goods prices since 
the beginning of the pandemic will persist. However, these prices could 
decline as supply chain bottlenecks dissipate and demand moderates. 
Oil prices and transportation costs could decrease more sharply 
than expected or growth in goods consumption could slow more than 
projected, particularly in the United States. If either of these scenarios 
occurs, inflation would be lower than projected.
Some large global retailers are reporting high levels of inventory after 
building up their stocks to avoid shortages. This could suggest some 
downside risk if retailers offer deep discounts to clear excess inventory.
(v)	
Sharper decline in housing activity and consumption in 
Canada (↓)
While the base case projects a significant decline in housing 
activity, a steep drop in homebuyer sentiment could amplify the 
decline in house prices. Significant drops in house prices would 
reduce household wealth and access to credit as well as undermine 
consumer confidence. This would weigh on demand, especially from 
highly indebted households that have taken out sizable mortgages to 
purchase a home. Higher borrowing rates and reduced access to credit 
could also have larger-than-expected dampening effects on household 
spending, business investment and employment.
	
Risks to the inflation outlook	 24
 
	
BANK OF CANADA  •  Monetary Policy Report  •  July 2022
Box 3
Scenario with a wage-price spiral
With infl
 ation high and broadening, infl
 ation expectations 
have moved upward. These rising infl
 ation expectations 
are occurring while the labour market is tight and wage 
growth is strong. This increases the risk that a self-
reinforcing wage-price spiral could ensue—a key upside 
risk to the infl
 ation outlook.
In this risk scenario, when infl
 ation remains persistently 
high, more households and fi
 rms base their infl
 ation 
expectations only on the most recent infl
 ation data. 
As a result, longer-term infl
 ation expectations become 
de-anchored and stay above the target.1 
De-anchored infl
 ation expectations lead fi
 rms to set 
prices even higher. Similarly, in response to higher 
expected infl
 ation, workers bargain for persistently 
higher wage growth to protect against anticipated losses 
in purchasing power. The resulting stronger wage 
growth feeds into production costs and prompts fi
 rms to 
raise prices even further. This process boosts infl
 ation 
expectations, perpetuating the spiral.
The longer infl
 ation remains well above target, the 
more likely it is that a wage-price spiral will occur. This 
likelihood also increases if fi
 rms have multi-year wage 
agreements in place with high wage increases in every 
year. 
1 This contrasts with the base case, which has long-run infl
 ation expectations 
remaining well anchored to the infl
 ation target.
Increased risk of recession
This risk scenario examines what could happen if a 
wage-price spiral occurred. The spiral prompts infl
 ation 
expectations, wages and prices to ratchet upward. 
With de-anchored expectations, infl
 ation stays higher 
than it would have been with easing demand and fl
 at or 
declining commodity prices.
To break the vicious circle, monetary policy works 
to re-anchor long-term infl
 ation expectations to the 
2% target. This is done by setting monetary policy much 
tighter than in the base case and creating additional 
excess supply. 
Chart 3-A (panel a) shows that, in this illustrative risk 
scenario, overall infl
 ation peaks at 8.6%, higher than in 
the base case. By the end of 2023, infl
 ation is at 6%, 
about 3 percentage points higher than in the base case. 
Growth of real gross domestic product is signifi
 cantly 
weaker, reaching a trough of about -2.5%, and Canada 
experiences a four-quarter recession (Chart 3-A, 
panel b). 
The Bank of Canada is keenly aware of the possibility of 
a wage-price spiral and is fi
 rmly committed to ensuring 
that this dynamic does not set in. This requires setting 
monetary policy much tighter than in the base case to 
ensure that long-run infl
 ation expectations remain well 
anchored. With infl
 ation expectations fi
 rmly anchored to 
the infl
 ation target, the likelihood of a wage-price spiral 
is greatly diminished.

inflation forecast errors
The Bank of Canada, like other central banks, has underpredicted inflation 
since spring 2021 (Chart A-1). Precisely quantifying the sources of inflation 
forecast errors is complex because many factors influence inflation at the 
same time, making it difficult to fully disentangle them. That said, global 
factors appear to explain about two-thirds of missed inflation through higher 
commodity prices, increased supply shortages and rising shipping costs 
(Chart A-2). The faster-than-expected recovery in the Canadian economy 
added to the Bank’s forecast errors but cannot explain most of the surprise: 
about one-quarter of the miss on inflation is explained by domestic factors, 
mostly housing costs.

Global shocks behind most errors
Higher-than-expected commodity prices 
The Bank typically uses a flat assumption about oil prices over its two- to 
three-year projection horizon. This assumption is based on work by Alquist 
et al. (2013), which shows that this approach was providing more accurate 
forecasts than other methods.7
Since 2020, however, the flat assumption has consistently underpredicted 
oil prices (Chart A-3). Commodity price effects alone account for over 40% 
of the Bank’s total underprediction of inflation. Refinery margins recently 
deviated unexpectedly from their historical levels, leading to higher gasoline 
prices. And the Russian invasion of Ukraine has driven prices for oil and 
natural gas even higher.
In the past, a strong correlation existed between oil prices and the Canadian 
dollar: as oil prices rose, the dollar appreciated. This helped offset the 
inflationary impact of higher energy prices by making imports into Canada 
cheaper. But recently, this relationship has not held, which means that higher 
oil prices have had an even greater effect on inflation.8 
In addition, other commodity prices have been unexpectedly high. For 
example, agricultural commodity prices have surged since 2021, largely due 
to unpredictable severe weather events. And the war in Ukraine has spiked 
wheat prices in particular.
As well, higher energy prices affected shipping costs, contributing to the 
steep rise in the price of goods globally.
7	 See R. Alquist, L. Kilian and R. J. Vigfusson, “Forecasting the Price of Oil,” in Handbook of Economic 
Forecasting, 2A, edited by G. Elliott and A. Timmermann (Amsterdam: North-Holland, 2013): 427–507. In 
recent reports, the Bank has deviated from the flat assumption about oil prices given the high volatility of 
oil prices due to the war in Ukraine.
8	 This relationship may have broken down in part because of uncertainty about demand for oil and natural 
gas in the long term. See T. Gravelle, “The perfect storm” (speech to the Association des économistes 
québécois, Montréal, Quebec, May 12, 2022).

Note: The projection error is the difference between the actual observed value for 2022Q2 (using the Bank of 
Canada’s assumption for June 2022) and the projected value in the April 2021 Report. Commodity price effects 
include direct impacts and unexpected pass-through of higher energy prices to other consumer prices. House 
prices refer to the direct impact of house prices through homeowners’ replacement costs and other owned 
accomodation expenses.

Stronger-than-anticipated tradable goods prices 
Instead of weakening as in past downturns, US consumer demand for 
goods unexpectedly surged well beyond pre-pandemic levels (Chart A-4).9 
Supported by fiscal policy measures, US household incomes turned out to be 
higher than anticipated. As well, the extent to which households shifted their 
spending into low-contact sectors was unexpected. Overall, strong foreign 
demand for tradable goods, such as appliances and furniture, has pushed up 
prices globally, including for Canadian consumers.
At the same time, the pandemic led to factory and port shutdowns around 
the world, upending supply chains for goods. The Bank had expected supply 
chains to be restored quickly once initial lockdown measures were lifted. 
However, further waves of the virus have caused continued disruptions, 
both globally and in Canada. In addition, the impact of supply challenges on 
consumer prices has been greater than anticipated. All told, roughly 20% of 
the forecast errors are related to global supply chain pressures.  
9	 Because the US economy is roughly 10 times larger than the Canadian economy, the impact of strong 
US demand on goods inventory is much larger than would have been the case if Canadian demand had 
rebounded by as much.

Faster-than-expected recovery in Canada
The fiscal and monetary policy response to the pandemic had stronger 
effects than initially anticipated.10 Instead of declining, household disposable 
incomes and consumer confidence rose. The inability to spend on in-person 
services also meant that savings soared for some households. These factors 
contributed to more robust demand for goods than anticipated.
The large accumulation of savings, low mortgage rates and changes in 
homebuyer preferences led to house prices growing by more than had been 
expected given the amount of slack in the economy. The sharp rise in house 
prices has boosted consumer price index inflation by 1.2 percentage points 
on average since the middle of 2021.
The early arrival of vaccines in spring 2021 sped up the economic recovery. 
This was evident in the labour market because people were able to return to 
work faster than anticipated.
In 2022, with the lifting of most public health restrictions, consumer 
cautiousness faded more quickly than in past downturns, and pent-up 
demand led to robust consumption growth. With the economy already in 
excess demand, the effects of domestic demand on inflation became more 
important. These effects are contributing to a broadening of high inflation into 
non-shelter services such as traveller accommodation and transportation.
Overall, commodity prices are the largest factor, explaining about 45% of 
the forecast errors over the past year. Global supply shortages and shipping 
costs as well as domestic factors are also important, each contributing over 
20%. That said, it is important to note that these are rough estimates that will 
evolve over time.
