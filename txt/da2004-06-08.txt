Ottawa, Ontario
June 8, 2004
The Bank of Canada today announced that it is maintaining its target for the
overnight rate at 2 per cent. The operating band for the overnight rate is
unchanged, and the Bank Rate remains at 2 1/4 per cent.
Economic information received since the release of the April Monetary Policy
Report (MPR) has been generally consistent with the Bank's expectations for
growth and core inflation, and reflects the Canadian economy's continuing
adjustment to global economic developments. The notable exception has been
the sharp rise in world oil prices in response to stronger-than-anticipated global
demand for oil and to heightened geopolitical uncertainties in the Middle East.
This implies that total CPI inflation over the next several months will be higher
than the Bank expected.
All things considered, the Bank's outlook for economic growth and core inflation is
essentially unchanged from the outlook in the April MPR. The Bank continues to
project that the economy will return close to its production potential by the third
quarter of 2005 and that core inflation will move back to the 2 per cent target by
the end of 2005.
In these circumstances, the Bank decided to leave the target for the overnight rate
unchanged.
