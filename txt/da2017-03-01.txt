The Bank of Canada today announced that it is maintaining its target for the
overnight rate at 1/2 per cent. The Bank Rate is correspondingly 3/4 per cent and
the deposit rate is 1/4 per cent.
CPI inflation rose to 2.1 per cent in January, reflecting higher energy prices due in
part to carbon pricing measures introduced in two provinces. The Bank is looking
through these effects, as their impact on inflation will be temporary. The Bank’s
three measures of core inflation, taken together, continue to point to material
excess capacity in the economy.
Overall, recent data on the global and Canadian economies have been consistent
with the Bank’s projection of improving growth, as set out in the January Monetary
Policy Report (MPR). In Canada, recent consumption and housing indicators
suggest growth in the fourth quarter of 2016 may have been slightly stronger than
expected. However, exports continue to face the ongoing competitiveness
challenges described in the January MPR. The Canadian dollar and bond yields
remain near levels observed at that time. While there have been recent gains in
employment, subdued growth in wages and hours worked continue to reflect
persistent economic slack in Canada, in contrast to the United States.
The Bank’s Governing Council remains attentive to the impact of significant
uncertainties weighing on the outlook and continues to monitor risks outlined in
the January MPR. In this context, Governing Council judges that the current stance
of monetary policy is still appropriate and maintains the target for the overnight
rate at 1/2 per cent.
