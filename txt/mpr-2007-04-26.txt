CANADA’S INFLATION-CONTROL STRATEGY*
Inflation control and the economy
• Inflation control is not an end in itself; it is the means whereby monetary
policy contributes to solid economic performance.
• Low inflation allows the economy to function more effectively. This con-
tributes to better economic growth over time and works to moderate
cyclical fluctuations in output and employment.
The monetary policy instrument
• Announcements regarding the Bank’s policy instrument—the target over-
night interest rate—take place, under normal circumstances, on eight pre-
specified dates during the year.
• In setting a target for the overnight rate, the Bank of Canada influences
short-term interest rates to achieve a rate of monetary expansion consis-
tent with the inflation-control target. The transmission mechanism is com-
plex and involves long and variable lags—the impact on inflation from
changes in policy rates is usually spread over six to eight quarters.
The targets
• In February 1991, the federal government and the Bank of Canada jointly
agreed on a series of targets for reducing total CPI inflation to the mid-
point of a range of 1 to 3 per cent by the end of 1995. The inflation tar-
get has been extended a number of times. In November 2006, the
agreement was renewed for a period of five years to the end of
2011. Under this agreement, the Bank will continue to conduct
monetary policy aimed at keeping total CPI inflation at 2 per cent,
with a control range of 1 to 3 per cent around the target.
Monitoring inflation
• In the short run, a good deal of movement in the CPI is caused by transi-
tory fluctuations in the prices of such volatile components as fruit and
gasoline, as well as by changes in indirect taxes. For this reason, the Bank
uses a core measure of CPI inflation as an indicator of the underlying trend
in inflation. This core measure excludes eight of the most volatile compo-
nents of the CPI and adjusts the remaining components to remove the
effect of changes in indirect taxes.

MONETARY POLICY REPORT
— April 2007 —
This is a report of the Governing Council of the Bank of Canada:
David Dodge, Paul Jenkins, Sheryl Kennedy, Pierre Duguay,
David Longworth, and Tiff Macklem.
By the early 1990s, the Bank decided to achieve
price stability by directly targeting inflation.
That inflation-targeting system worked so well
that it has been renewed four times, most
recently near the end of last year. This means
that we will continue with our goal of holding
inflation to 2 per cent . . . over the coming five
years.

Governor, Bank of Canada

1. OVERVIEW
Growth in the Canadian economy has been essentially in line
with the expectations set out in the Bank’s January Monetary Policy
Report Update. But inflation has been higher than expected because
pressures on capacity over the past year have been stronger than
previously judged, and the prices of food and gasoline have
recently risen more than expected. After considering the full range
of indicators, the Bank now judges that the Canadian economy
was operating just above its production capacity in the first quar-
ter of this year.
Robust domestic demand continues to support Canada’s eco-
nomic growth, and there has also been stronger-than-expected
growth outside North America, which has led to rising demand
for, and prices of, many commodities. However, the slowing U.S.
economy has had a moderating effect on economic growth in
Canada.
Over the projection horizon, domestic demand should remain
robust, although not as strong as in recent years. With the U.S.
slowdown now expected to be somewhat more prolonged than
previously projected, net exports should exert a slightly greater
drag on growth in 2007. All told, the Canadian economy is
expected to expand at a rate slower than potential through 2007,
and in line with potential through 2008 and 2009.
With the excess demand in the economy expected to disappear
in the second half of this year, and with pressures on housing
prices expected to continue to ease, core inflation is projected to
decline to 2 per cent by the end of 2007 and remain there through
the projection period. If energy prices evolve in line with those
currently reflected in futures markets, total inflation should aver-
age just below 2 per cent in the second quarter of 2007 before moving
above the 2 per cent target and peaking below 3 per cent near the end
of 2007. Total inflation should then return to target by mid-2008.
The upside risk to the Bank’s inflation projection is that the
recent strength of inflation could be more persistent than pro-
jected. Pressures on capacity could be greater and more prolonged
than currently judged. The strong growth in household credit and
broad money continues to point to this upside risk. As well, the
downward pressure on inflation from the prices of imported
goods could diminish more quickly than expected, and global food
and energy prices could put more upward pressure on inﬂation.
This report includes information received up to the ﬁxed announcement date on
24 April 2007.

The downside risk to inflation continues to come from the pos-
sibility of a slowdown in the U.S. economy that is more pro-
nounced than that already incorporated in the Bank’s base-case
projection.
The Bank continues to judge that the risks to its inflation pro-
jection are roughly balanced, although there is now a slight tilt to
the upside.
The Bank left its key policy interest rate unchanged at 4.25 per
cent on 6 March and 24 April. The current level of the target for
the overnight rate is judged, at this time, to be consistent with
achieving the inflation target over the medium term.

2. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN INFLATION
Inflation and the 2 per cent target
CPI inflation rose to
1.9 per cent in the first
quarter of 2007 . . .
. . . which was higher than
expected.
The year-over-year rate of increase in the total CPI has been
higher than projected in the January Update, having risen from 1.3 per
cent in the last quarter of 2006 to 1.9 per cent in the ﬁrst quarter of
2007. If the effect of changes in indirect taxes is excluded, the rate
of increase in the total CPI in the first quarter of 2007 was 2.4 per
cent. The core rate of inflation increased to 2.3 per cent over the
same period (Chart 1), also slightly higher than expected.1
The core rate of inflation has been moving up since the spring of
2006. Capacity pressures stemming from strong domestic demand
have contributed to an increase in inflationary pressures, especially on
the prices of components such as shelter services and, to a lesser
extent, of services other than shelter.2 As well, the downward pressure
on the core rate coming from reduced prices for many import-
1. The core measure of inﬂation excludes eight of the most volatile compo-
nents of the CPI and removes the effect of changes in indirect taxes on the
remaining components. The eight volatile components are fruit, vegetables,
gasoline, fuel oil, natural gas, intercity transportation, tobacco, and mortgage-
interest costs.

intensive goods (such as clothing and durable goods other than auto-
mobiles) has lessened somewhat.
In addition to higher-
than-expected increases
in the prices of several
components of the core
rate of inflation . . .
In the first quarter of 2007, the year-over-year rate of increase
in housing prices eased slightly more than anticipated at the time
of the January Update. However, this was more than offset by
higher-than-expected increases in the prices of several other com-
ponents of the core rate of inflation. In particular, the recent surge
in the prices of grains and oilseeds, stemming partly from the per-
sistent rise in the demand for biofuels, has contributed to higher
core food prices. Prices of imported clothing, durable goods
excluding autos, and of core services other than housing have also
come in higher than anticipated.
. . . there have been unan-
ticipated increases in the
prices of more volatile
components.
The higher-than-expected increase in total CPI inflation in the
first quarter of 2007 reflected both the higher-than-projected core
rate and increases in the prices of some of the more volatile com-
ponents. Fruit and vegetable prices rose unexpectedly as a result
of weather-related reductions in North American supplies. Gaso-
line prices were higher than projected, partly owing to temporary
production disruptions at oil refineries, although the impact of
higher prices for crude oil also played a role.
The underlying trend
of inflation has been
running slightly above
2 per cent.
Key medium- and longer-
term indicators of infla-
tion expectations remain
quite close to 2 per cent.
Other measures of the trend rate of inﬂation that the Bank follows
have also moved up above 2 per cent when the effect of changes in
indirect taxes is excluded (Chart 2).3
Key medium- and longer-term measures of inflation expecta-
tions continue to be close to 2 per cent. In the Bank’s spring Busi-
ness Outlook Survey, 88 per cent of ﬁrms expected CPI inﬂation to be
within a range of 1 to 3 per cent, on average, over the next two years.
Consistent with the temporary reduction in CPI inﬂation stemming
from the cut in the GST, the average private sector forecast for total
CPI inflation in 2007 was slightly below 2 per cent, while consen-
sus forecasts of inflation over the longer term continued to be very
close to 2 per cent.
3. Note that CPIW is affected by changes in the GST and other indirect taxes.
Removing this effect would push the rate of change of CPIW above 2 per cent.

Factors at work on inflation
Aggregate demand
As projected, growth in
Canada’s real GDP slowed
further in the fourth
quarter of 2006.
Real GDP growth in Canada slowed modestly in the second
half of 2006, increasing by 2.0 per cent in the third quarter and by
1.4 per cent in the fourth quarter. The outcome for the fourth quar-
ter was very close to the 1.5 per cent projected in the January
Update,4 with a decrease in inventory investment exerting a signif-
icant drag on growth (Chart 3). The inventory correction appears
to have been largely completed by the end of 2006. Currently
available information suggests that real GDP grew by about 2.5 per
cent in the ﬁrst quarter of 2007, close to the 2.4 per cent rate projected
in the last Update.
While final domestic
demand has slowed some-
what since the middle
of 2006, it remained the
chief driver of GDP
growth.
Although the growth of final domestic demand has slowed
since the middle of 2006 from the very strong pace registered in
the first half, it remained the chief driver of GDP growth. Further
substantial increases in capital spending by businesses reflected
relatively high overall profitability, earlier reductions in the prices
of imported machinery and equipment, and continued favourable
financing conditions. With solid employment growth, real per-
sonal disposable income continued to rise, as did household net

worth and household credit, contributing to ongoing strength in
consumer spending. In contrast, the growth of government spend-
ing on goods and services lessened appreciably. Residential con-
struction decreased as expected.
Inventory investment in
Canada’s motor-vehicle-
related industries
decreased appreciably . . .
The U.S. economic slowdown has continued to affect Canada’s
economic growth. In particular, the weak level of motor vehicle
sales in the United States contributed to significant production
cuts in the Canadian auto industry. Consequently, inventory
investment
in
motor-vehicle-related
industries
in
Canada
decreased sharply, especially in the fourth quarter of the year. As
well, further large declines in residential investment in the United
States resulted in reductions in Canadian exports of lumber and,
to a lesser extent, other building materials. (See Technical Box 1.)
. . . while exports recov-
ered in the second half of
2006.
Nevertheless, Canada’s total exports recovered in the second
half of 2006. Exports of machinery and equipment, metals and
minerals, and agricultural and fish products all rose strongly after
mid-2006. At the same time, after another strong gain in the third
quarter of 2006, imports eased towards year-end and into this
year, partly as a result of the reduced inventory investment by
Canadian businesses.

Developments in the U.S. Housing Market and Their Implications for Canada
After several years of rapid sales growth, large price increases, and rising construction,
the U.S. housing sector began to contract in 2006. Sales of new and existing homes declined
early in the year, causing a sharp increase in inventories of unsold homes. Builders conse-
quently cut construction of new homes, leading to a 13 per cent decrease in real residential
investment in new structures through the four quarters of 2006. Recent data on the U.S.
housing sector point to a further contraction of real residential investment. The Bank’s base-
case projection calls for real residential investment to decrease by another 12 per cent during
2007, with much of the decline occurring in the first two quarters. In the first half of 2008,
however, the inventory of unsold new homes is expected to return to its long-term average,
and growth in residential construction is projected to resume thereafter.1
The decline in U.S. residential investment through 2006 had an important impact on
Canadian exports, especially wood products, since construction materials used in the
United States have a very high Canadian content relative to other goods. However, this
impact could have been affected by changes in Canada’s relative competitiveness, by price
and inventory movements, and by sector-specific developments, such as the October 2006
softwood lumber agreement. Although these and other factors introduce a large degree of
uncertainty, the Bank’s analysis suggests that the projected decline of 12 per cent in U.S. res-
idential investment in 2007 could lead to an additional drop in Canadian exports of con-
struction-related products2 of about 13 per cent on a year-over-year basis by the fourth
quarter of 2007. This would translate into an adverse impact on Canadian real GDP of about
-0.3 percentage points over the same period. If the downturn in U.S. housing was to signifi-
cantly affect U.S. consumer spending, other types of exports would also be affected, and the
negative impact on GDP would be larger.
1. An additional factor affecting the U.S. housing market is the recent rise in the rate of delinquen-
cies and defaults on subprime mortgages, which will bring more houses onto the market. While the
macroeconomic impacts from these developments currently seem limited, there is a risk that lend-
ers may respond by tightening overall mortgage lending, which could prolong the decline in the
U.S. housing market.
2. The measure of Canadian exports of key construction-related products includes products that are
heavily inﬂuenced by U.S. residential investment, but it also includes products that may be used in
other sectors of the U.S. or global economy.

Aggregate supply
Growth in labour input
has been higher than
expected . . .
In recent years, most of the growth in output has come from
increases in labour input (as indicated by hours worked), rather
than from gains in labour productivity. For the 2004–06 period,
annual growth in hours worked in the business sector averaged
about 1.8 per cent, which was well above expectations. Most of
this growth came from the expansion of the working-age popula-
tion. In the fourth quarter of 2006, hours worked continued to
increase solidly, with year-over-year growth of 1.8 per cent.
. . . while growth in
labour productivity has
been weaker than
expected.
Annual growth in labour productivity in the business sector
averaged about 1.2 per cent for the 2004–06 period, down from
2.3 per cent over the 1996–2000 period. One factor contributing to
the slowdown in productivity growth could be the large amount
of structural adjustment under way in the Canadian economy in
the face of rising global competition and stronger demand for
commodities, which has pushed up commodity prices and the
trade-weighted value of the Canadian dollar. In particular, labour
and capital have been moving towards commodity production and
the non-tradable goods and services sectors. It is reasonable to
expect that labour and capital could be somewhat less productive
during the transition period. Also, higher commodity prices
encourage the production of resources that are more difficult and
costly to extract, dampening productivity in those sectors.
Productivity growth was particularly slow in the second half
of 2006, with measured productivity in the fourth quarter up only
0.4 per cent from a year earlier (Chart 4). In addition to the factors
noted above, some of this weakness would also appear to be cycli-
cal in nature, reflecting the inventory correction and more general
weakness in the manufacturing sector. As well, productivity in the
services sector continues to be below expectations. All told, espe-
cially given the recent strength in investment, the extent of the
weakness in overall productivity remains somewhat puzzling.
Growth in potential out-
put over the 2004–06
period is now estimated
to have averaged 2.6 per
cent.
The Bank estimates potential output over history by breaking
out movements in labour supply and labour productivity into
their trend and cyclical components. Using its conventional meas-
ure, the Bank currently estimates that average growth in potential
output over the 2004–06 period was 2.6 per cent. This is somewhat
lower than the 2.8 per cent to 3 per cent that had been assumed in
projections of potential output growth over that period. This
slower pace of growth in potential output over the past several
years largely reflects the weakness in the growth of actual labour
productivity, which has more than offset higher-than-expected
growth in labour input.

Estimated pressures on capacity
Some indicators suggest
that the economy has
been operating in slight
excess demand . . .
Several indicators of capacity pressures continue to suggest
that the economy has been operating in slight excess demand. In
the spring Business Outlook Survey from the Bank’s regional offices,
the percentage of firms reporting that they would have difficulty
in meeting an unanticipated increase in demand remained above
average (Chart 5). The employment-to-population ratio in March
2007 was at its highest level in 31 years, and the unemployment
rate in both February and March was at a 31-year low. The Bank’s
conventional measure of the output gap, which is subject to a sub-
stantial degree of uncertainty, indicates that the economy was
operating about 0.2 per cent above its production potential in the
first quarter of 2007 (Chart 5), slightly higher than was expected in
the January Update.5
The fact that the core rate of inflation has averaged slightly
above 2 per cent since September 2006 is also consistent with an
economy operating slightly above its production capacity.

5. This change is due to the slight downward revision in the conventional
measure of production capacity over history, such that the estimated level in
the fourth quarter of 2006 is about 0.1 per cent lower than the previous esti-
mate. As discussed in the previous section, this downward revision in the esti-
mated level of production capacity reﬂects the sustained weakness in actual
labour productivity growth, which has not been fully offset by the observed
strength in labour input.

. . . while others point to
an economy either in bal-
ance or in slight excess
supply.
In contrast, other indicators suggest that the economy may be
either in balance or even in slight excess supply. The percentage of
firms reporting labour shortages in the Bank’s spring survey,
while up slightly from the previous survey, was still only about
average on a historical basis. Statistics Canada’s measure of capac-
ity utilization in the non-farm, goods-producing sector suggested
below-average pressure on production capacity by the fourth
quarter of 2006.
The underlying trend increase in aggregate wages (based on
the 12-month change in average hourly earnings of permanent
workers reported by Statistics Canada in the Labour Force Survey)
has fallen to between 2 1/4 per cent and 3 per cent since the third
quarter of 2006 (Chart 6). The year-to-year rise in another wage
indicator—hourly labour compensation from Statistics Canada’s
Productivity Accounts—decreased to just over 3 per cent in the
fourth quarter of 2006 (Chart 4).6
6. The marked reduction in the average annual wage increase in the unionized
private sector in the fourth quarter of 2006 resulted chieﬂy from low settle-
ments negotiated in the retail sector.

The Governing Council
judges that the economy
was operating just above
its production capacity in
the first quarter of 2007.
Given the very low gains in productivity, unit labour costs in
the fourth quarter of 2006 were up 2.7 per cent from their level a
year earlier. With recent compensation increases ranging between
2 1/4 per cent and 3 per cent and with trend productivity growth
estimated at about 1 per cent in 2006, underlying increases in unit
labour costs seem to have been lower, at just under 2 per cent.
After reviewing all the indicators of capacity pressures, it is
the Governing Council’s judgment that, overall, the economy was
operating just above its production capacity in the first quarter of
2007.
Commodity and output prices and the terms of trade
Canada’s terms of trade decreased further in the second half of
2006, owing to somewhat lower prices for energy commodities
after the middle of the year (Chart 7). Consequently, the four-
quarter change in the chain price index for GDP (a broad price
measure of the goods and services produced in Canada) eased
from 3.0 per cent in the second quarter of 2006 to 0.5 per cent in
the fourth quarter (Chart 8). This contributed to further modera-
tion in the annual increase in nominal GDP, which rose by only
2.8 per cent in the year ending in the fourth quarter of 2006.

mid-January . . .
Growth in global demand for commodities continues to be
underpinned by the strong global economy, particularly in the
emerging-market economies led by China and India. Combined
with delays in several major projects intended to expand supplies,
this has led to further increases in the world prices of many non-
energy commodities since the January Update (Chart 9).
. . . as has the price of
crude oil.
The price of light crude oil (West Texas Intermediate), which
was about US$53 per barrel at the time of the January Update,
averaged US$63 in the ten days ending on 20 April 2007. This
increase was chiefly caused by strengthening North American

demand with the return of normal winter weather conditions, as
well as by somewhat greater geopolitical uncertainties. Natural
gas prices are also up a little relative to January.
This recent improvement in most commodity prices should
lead to a recovery in Canada’s terms of trade in early 2007 and,
thus, to somewhat stronger growth in nominal GDP. This strength-
ened rate of nominal income growth should, in turn, help to
increase the growth of corporate profits and government tax reve-
nues in the near term.

3. FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
The global economy continues to be characterized by high lev-
els of desired savings relative to desired investment. This has con-
tributed to a financial environment that exhibits low levels of
long-term interest rates and strong investor appetite for risk,
reflected in the low level of risky spreads. Moreover, equity mar-
kets and debt issuance around the world have been buoyant. In
February and March, volatility and risk premiums rose in many
markets from historically low levels, but have since largely
returned to those low levels. The main exception is the U.S. sub-
prime mortgage market, where some difficulties persist and fur-
ther deterioration is possible.
Policy interest rates and exchange rates
In Canada, financial mar-
ket expectations are for
no change in the policy
rate in 2007.
Policy rates in both Canada and the United States have
remained unchanged since the middle of 2006 (Chart 10). Short-
term interest rates in the United States reflect expectations of a
modest decline in the federal funds rate in the second half of 2007.
In Canada, market expectations derived from short-term interest
rates imply no change in the policy rate in 2007.
Responding to the sustained strength of their economies, sev-
eral central banks, including the Bank of England, the European
Central Bank, and the Bank of Japan, have continued to raise their
policy rates since the beginning of the year. Financial markets
expect a further tightening of monetary policy in these countries
over the remainder of 2007 and into early 2008.
The recent strength of the
Canadian dollar reflects a
number of developments.
Through the first quarter of 2007, the Canadian dollar traded
in the range of about 84.5 to 87.5 cents U.S. assumed in the projec-
tion presented in the January Update (Chart 11). However, since
early April, the Canadian dollar has moved above this range as a
result of several developments, including the rise in commodity
prices and relatively stronger economic data in Canada than in the
United States.

Credit conditions and other financial developments
Corporate profitability in Canada remains robust. Balance
sheets in the Canadian non-financial business sector continue to
improve, buoyed by rising profit margins. Profits have also been
very strong in the financial sector since the October Report.
Business borrowing
conditions remain
accommodative.
Against this backdrop, credit conditions for businesses remain
accommodative (Chart 12). Despite high corporate profits, which
have dampened the demand for credit, business borrowing since
the January Update has expanded at a rate close to its historical
average, partly reflecting increased demand for short-term financ-
ing related to mergers and acquisitions, as well as robust capital
spending. The healthy outlook for the global economy should help
to sustain the strong profitability of Canadian businesses. To the
extent that credit spreads remain low, firms should continue to
have ready access to funding for investment.
Healthy household
balance sheets and rising
house prices are enabling
households to borrow to
help support spending.
Household credit continues to expand at a rate well above its
historical average (Chart 12). This has been partly due to borrow-
ing against home equity. Rising house prices have improved the
net worth of households and have facilitated cheaper access to
borrowed funds. Total new borrowing against home equity has tri-
pled in volume since 2001 (Technical Box 2) and has contributed to
the strength of household spending over this period. Since the Jan-
uary Update, the growth in housing prices has moderated some-
what, but past increases have allowed household borrowing to
remain robust.

Total Home Equity Borrowing in Canada
Homeowners can take advantage of increases in housing equity by raising the
amount of their borrowing against home equity. This occurs through two main
channels: borrowing through a home equity line of credit or increasing the amount
of the original mortgage (mortgage reﬁnancing).
There is no single source of information on total home equity borrowing in
Canada. It is therefore necessary to derive this series from several sources. Esti-
mates by Bank staff of home equity lines of credit, which include lending by both
chartered banks and non-bank ﬁnancial institutions, are based on Bank of Canada
credit data and information from a household survey undertaken by Ipsos Reid
market research. Estimates of mortgage reﬁnancing are calculated using survey
data from Altus Clayton consulting services.

Despite higher indebtedness, households remain in sound
financial health, with a relatively low debt-service ratio for the
sector as a whole and only a small proportion of financially vul-
nerable households.7 Healthy household balance sheets, together
with favourable employment conditions and ready access to bor-
rowed funds, suggest that robust credit growth should continue to
support household spending.
Growth in the monetary
aggregates remains high.
Since January, the growth rate of the monetary aggregates has
remained high (Chart 13). The growth of broad money (M2++) is
consistent with a core rate of inflation slightly above 2 per cent at
the end of 2007 and into early 2008. At the same time, the break-
even inflation rate implicit in the spread between nominal and
Real Return government bonds has moved up slightly. Liquidity
and technical factors, however, make this spread difficult to
interpret.

4.THE OUTLOOK
Demographic develop-
ments will reduce the
future growth of potential
output in the major
economies.
This section describes the Bank’s outlook for the global and
Canadian economies through to the end of 2009. The base-case
projection has been developed assuming a slow and orderly reso-
lution of global imbalances, predicated on further supportive pol-
icy actions to rebalance global demand and a gradual real effective
depreciation of the U.S. dollar. Energy prices are assumed to
evolve in line with current futures prices, and the Canadian dollar
is assumed to trade within the range of 86.5 to 89.5 cents U.S., evi-
dent since early April. With the projection horizon extended to
2009, demographic effects related to an aging workforce begin to
modestly reduce the assumption for the growth of potential out-
put, not only in Canada, but for many industrialized countries.8
The section concludes with a discussion of the risks to the base-
case projection.
International background
Economic momentum
remains strong in the
major overseas
economies . . .
Since the January Update, global economic growth has been
slightly stronger than expected, with slower growth in U.S. real
GDP more than offset by stronger-than-expected growth outside
North America. As global capacity becomes fully absorbed and
monetary policy tightens, this vigorous expansion is projected to
moderate gradually from 5.3 per cent in 2006, to 4.8 per cent in
2007 and 2008, and to 4.6 per cent in 2009 (Table 1). This growth
projection is slightly higher than that presented in the October
Report and the January Update.
Growth
in
Japan
and
the
major
European
economies
is
expected to remain solid over the projection period, with more
growth
coming
from
domestic
consumption
and
investment
demand, rather than from net exports. The outlook for growth in
emerging-market countries over the same period also remains
very strong, particularly for China and India.
8. The negative impact of aging populations on labour supply growth is pro-
jected to occur over different periods and to varying degrees among the
advanced economies. For example, with the oldest U.S. baby boomers becom-
ing eligible for pension beneﬁts in 2008, the contribution of labour to potential
growth is expected to diminish over coming years. Shifts in the working-age
population are also expected to reduce potential growth rates in the major
overseas economies, although this may be partly offset by gains in labour pro-
ductivity from capital deepening and from the adoption of more efﬁcient tech-
nologies. See Technical Box 3 for a discussion of the impact of demographics
on trend labour input in Canada.

. . . but the U.S. slowdown
is expected to be more
prolonged than previously
projected.
The slowdown in the U.S. economy in 2007 is expected to be
more prolonged than projected in the January Update. As a result,
U.S. GDP growth is expected to slow to 2.1 per cent in 2007, before
picking up to 2.8 per cent in 2008 and to 3.1 per cent in 2009. The
downward revision in 2007 (from 2.5 per cent in the January
Update to 2.1 per cent) largely reflects a more prolonged downturn
in residential investment and weaker business investment. The
growth rate of U.S. potential output is now expected to slow from
about 3 per cent over recent years to slightly below 3 per cent over
the 2007–09 period.
With the slowing of U.S. GDP growth to well below potential
growth since the middle of 2006, some excess supply has started
to emerge in the U.S. economy. Thus, core inflation should gradu-
ally fall, although less quickly than previously expected. As inven-
tory adjustments in the manufacturing sector are completed and
the drag from weak residential and business investment dissi-
pates, U.S. GDP growth is expected to recover to close to potential
growth by the end of 2007.
Over the projection horizon, growth in U.S. household con-
sumption is expected to moderate, as savings return to a more
sustainable level. The depreciation of the U.S. dollar in real effec-
tive terms since 2002, as well as a further expected depreciation of
about 8 per cent over the projection horizon, should continue to

stimulate U.S. net exports.9 Strong foreign demand should further
support U.S. exports, contributing to a gradual reduction in the
U.S. current account deficit.
Prices of energy futures
are higher than in
January.
Futures prices for crude oil and natural gas over the projection
period are higher than those in the January Update (Chart 14).
They indicate that crude oil prices will move up from their current
level of about US$63 per barrel to US$70 per barrel by early 2008
and then stay there for the remainder of next year and through
2009.
Non-energy commodity
prices should stay
relatively high before
declining modestly.
The price index for non-energy commodities is high and is
expected to remain higher than projected in January, before declin-
ing gradually over the projection period. In particular, while
strong global demand is boosting metals prices, these prices are
expected to decrease slowly as increases in global capacity come
online. Lumber prices are likely to ease over the remainder of this
year, given the projected weakness of U.S. housing activity. On the
other hand, prices for grains and oilseeds are anticipated to
remain strong for some time as a result of the surging demand for
biofuels.
9. In its April 2006 Monetary Policy Report, the Bank assumed a real effective
depreciation of the U.S. dollar over the 2007–08 period of 7 per cent. Since
then, the U.S. dollar has depreciated by about 3 per cent. The Bank’s outlook
for the U.S. economy now extends through to the end of 2009.

Aggregate demand and supply in Canada
Final domestic demand is
expected to be the primary
engine of growth in
Canada.
In Canada, ﬁnal domestic demand is expected to continue to be
the primary engine of growth over the projection period, growing at
a robust, though more moderate, pace than in 2005 and 2006
(Table 2).
Consumer spending is expected to grow solidly over the pro-
jection period, reflecting further gains in real disposable income and
increases in household net worth. Housing investment, after reach-
ing a very high level last year, is projected to decline slightly in
2007 and 2008 and then to steady out in 2009.
Gains in business investment are expected to remain strong in
2007 and 2008, with growth averaging just over 5 per cent. Factors
contributing to higher investment spending this year and next
include near-term pressures on production capacity, expectations
of relatively strong global economic growth and high levels for
most commodity prices, ongoing supportive financial conditions,
and generally strong proﬁt levels with solid balance sheets. How-
ever, capital spending in the oil and gas industry is expected to
ease somewhat in the near term, owing to a weaker outlook for
gas drilling. In 2009, overall growth in investment is projected to
ease as a result of the anticipated moderation in global economic
growth and lower prices for non-energy commodities.

In the base-case projection, it is assumed that the government
sector will run balanced budgets throughout the projection period,
and that the real growth of government spending on goods and
services will decelerate to average just under 3 per cent through 2009.
Net exports are expected
to continue to exert a drag
on growth through 2007.
As growth in U.S. domestic demand slows through mid-2007,
Canadian exports are expected to ease slightly in the first half of
2007. But with the projected subsequent strengthening of U.S.
growth, Canada’s exports should pick up over the remainder of
the projection period. In contrast, further substantial increases in
investment in machinery and equipment should contribute to con-
tinued strong growth in imports throughout 2007 and 2008.
Hence, net exports are projected to exert a slightly greater drag on
overall growth in 2007 than projected in the January Update, with
this drag diminishing over the course of the year.
GDP growth in Canada is
projected to be 2.2 per cent
in 2007 and 2.7 per cent in
both 2008 and 2009.
In the Bank’s base-case projection, economic growth increases
through 2007, with quarterly growth averaging just below 2 1/2 per
cent in the first half of the year and just above 2 1/2 per cent in
the second half (Chart 15). This implies average annual growth for
2007 of 2.2 per cent, slightly lower than in the January Update,
largely reflecting the impact of the weaker U.S. economic outlook
on Canadian export growth. For 2008 and 2009, GDP growth is pro-
jected at 2.7 per cent.
In the base-case scenario for Canada, the assumption for
potential output growth in both 2007 and 2008 remains unchanged
at 2.8 per cent.10 For 2009, growth of the labour supply is assumed
10. This continues to reﬂect an assumed rate of trend labour productivity
growth of 1 1/2 per cent and trend growth in labour input of 1 1/4 per cent.

to ease slightly by 0.1 per cent from 1 1/4 per cent in 2007 and
2008, implying potential growth of about 2.7 per cent. This 0.1 per-
centage point reduction in potential growth in 2009 reflects the
Governing Council’s judgment regarding the impact on the labour
force of increased retirements as the first members of the baby-
boom generation enter their early sixties. (See Technical Box 3.)11
With these growth profiles for GDP and potential growth, the
economy would move back to its production capacity in the sec-
ond half of 2007 and
stay there for the remainder of
the
projection period. In this base-case projection, it is chiefly the
recent slowdown and subsequent pickup of the U.S. economy that
bring aggregate supply and demand in Canada back into balance
and keep them there.
The outlook for inflation
Core inflation is expected
to return to 2 per cent by
the end of 2007.
The Bank’s projection is that core inflation will remain above
2 per cent in the coming months, but return to 2 per cent by the
end of 2007 and stay there for the rest of the projection period
(Table 3). With medium- and longer-term expectations of inflation
well anchored, the inflation projection largely reflects the com-
bined influence of the balance between aggregate demand and
supply, and relative price developments. Excess demand through
late 2006 and into 2007, combined with the projected momentum
in core food prices, is expected to keep core inflation above 2 per
cent in the near term. But two factors are expected to bring core
inflation back to 2 per cent, despite a projected lessening of the
downward pressure from import prices. First, the upward pres-
sure coming from the economy operating slightly above its poten-
tial output is expected to dissipate, since excess demand is
projected to be eliminated in the second half of 2007. Second, the
significant contribution to inflation coming from housing price
increases is expected to continue to decline.
Total CPI inflation is
expected to return to 2 per
cent by mid-2008 and
remain there over the rest
of the projection period.
The projected path for the 12-month rate of increase in the
total CPI reflects both the slightly higher projected track for core
inflation in 2007 and expectations for energy prices, as well as
changes in indirect taxes. Total CPI inflation is expected to be
1.9 per cent in the second quarter of 2007. With the direct effect of

implications of various factors that are not captured by the estimated model,
informed the Governing Council’s assumptions regarding the growth of trend
labour supply.

increases in gasoline prices, total CPI inflation is projected to move
up in the second half of 2007, peaking in the fourth quarter of
2007 at about 2.8 per cent.12 Thereafter, total
CPI inflation is
expected to decline, returning to the 2 per cent target by mid-2008
and staying there for the remainder of the projection period.
This inflation projection is consistent with an unchanged target
for the overnight interest rate, largely because the impact of the
current slowdown in U.S. GDP growth on the Canadian economy is
sufficient to bring total demand for goods and services in Canada
back into line with supply.
12. The year-over-year rate of increase in gasoline prices is expected to spike
up in the last quarter of 2007, owing partly to base-year effects related to a
temporary easing in gasoline prices in 2006.

Estimates of Trend Labour Input
Over the next two years, the leading edge of the baby boom cohort—those born
between 1946 and 1964—will reach 62 years of age, the average age of retirement in Can-
ada. This development will put downward pressure on the growth of labour supply and,
hence, on that of potential output over the coming decades.
Since 1980, growth in labour input has accounted for just over half of real GDP
growth.1 Most of this rise in labour input growth can be attributed to an increase in the
working-age population and to the strong increase in the labour force participation of
women. These two factors have been partially offset by a declining trend in average
hours worked.
Bank staff have estimated the trend in labour input over the next decade by combin-
ing Statistics Canada projections of the working-age population with models of the aver-
age length of the workweek and the labour force employment rate. Statistics Canada
projects that growth in the working-age population will begin declining in 2007 and will
continue to decline over the next decade because of the cumulative impact of past
decreases in the national fertility rate (Chart A).2 Bank modelling projects average hours
worked to remain relatively stable over the next decade. Using a cohort-based model,3
Bank staff estimate that the aggregate trend employment rate began to fall in 2006, owing
to the increased share in the workforce of individuals 62 and over whose average
employment rates are lower than those of younger workers (Chart B). This analysis also
suggests that the recent increase in the employment rates of women aged 55 and over is
mainly a structural phenomenon that will likely continue in the years to come. This
should help moderate the drop in the aggregate employment rate.
Accordingly, the model-based estimate of trend labour input growth falls from
1.5 per cent over the 2004–06 period to 1.1 per cent over the 2007–09 period and to 0.6 per
cent over the 2013–15 period.
Several factors that could help to offset some of the estimated decline in the employ-
ment rate are not accounted for in the model. As the labour pool shrinks, employers and
governments may take further measures to reduce or eliminate barriers to continued
labour force participation beyond the conventional retirement age. Continued improve-
ments in health and life expectancy, together with the changing nature of work towards
jobs that are less physically demanding, might raise the employment rates of older work-
ers. If couples are making joint retirement decisions, the projected increase in the employ-
ment rates of older women might have a positive spillover effect on the employment
rates of older men (although this effect could also work in the other direction). Finally, the
projected reduction in the labour supply might increase the real wage, creating an incen-
tive for more young workers to enter the labour market and for older workers to delay
their retirement. For these and other reasons, some judgment is applied to the model-
based estimates in coming to a balanced view of trend labour supply growth
going forward.
1. Real output growth can be divided into labour productivity growth and labour input growth.
The latter can be decomposed further into growth of the working-age population, the change in the
labour force employment rate, and the change in the average length of the workweek. The labour
force employment rate is deﬁned as the number of people employed divided by the labour force.
Trend labour input is driven by the trend in labour supply.
2. The medium scenario from Statistics Canada’s population projections is used to project the size
and composition of the working-age population. For more details on the assumptions underlying
the population projection, see Statistics Canada (2005), Population Projections for Canada, Provinces
and Territories.
3. The trend employment rate is projected using a birth-cohort-speciﬁc model that captures move-
ments in labour demand, age effects, wealth effects, the impact of the E.I. system, and a birth-cohort
effect for females. A more detailed description will be provided in an upcoming Bank of Canada
Review article.

Risks to the outlook
There are both upside and downside risks to the Bank’s base-
case outlook for inflation.
The upside risk relates
to the persistence of the
recent increase in
inflation.
The upside risk is that the recent strength in inflation could
prove to be more persistent than is envisaged in the base-case pro-
jection. Pressures on capacity may be greater than judged and may
be more persistent than projected. The observed strength in house-
hold credit growth and broad money growth in Canada continues
to point to this upside risk. There is also a risk of greater interna-
tional price pressures. The downward pressure on the core infla-
tion rate from decreases in the prices of internationally traded
manufactured goods could diminish more quickly than projected,
especially if global growth continues to come in stronger than
expected. Global food and energy prices could also boost inflation
more than projected in the base case.
The downside risk
continues to be lower-
than-expected growth in
the U.S. economy.
The downside risk to the outlook for Canadian growth and
inflation continues to be that growth in the U.S. economy could be
lower than expected. This arises from the possibility of an even
more pronounced slowdown in residential and business invest-
ment in the United States, which could spill over into weaker
consumption growth. Weaker growth in domestic demand in the
United States would further reduce demand for Canadian exports
and would lower inflation relative to the base-case projection.
The risks to the inflation
projection are roughly
balanced, with a slight
tilt to the upside.
The Bank continues to judge that the risks to its inflation pro-
jection are roughly balanced, although there is now a slight tilt to
the upside.
Finally, from a longer-term perspective, there remains a small
probability of a disorderly resolution of global imbalances. While
the improving balance in the global distribution of domestic
demand will be helpful in supporting necessary adjustment, fur-
ther policy actions are required internationally to facilitate an
orderly resolution of global imbalances.
