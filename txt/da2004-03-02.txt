Ottawa, Ontario
March 2, 2004
The Bank of Canada today announced that it is lowering its target for the
overnight rate by one-quarter of one percentage point to 2 1/4 per cent. The
operating band for the overnight rate is correspondingly lowered, and the Bank
Rate is now 2 1/2 per cent.
Information received since the Bank's last interest rate announcement has been
broadly consistent with the economic outlook presented in the January Monetary
Policy Report Update. As expected, core and total CPI inflation in January moved
significantly below the 2 per cent inflation target. While external demand has
been slightly stronger and final domestic demand in Canada slightly weaker than
expected, the Bank's outlook remains, on balance, unchanged.
In this context, today's decision to provide some additional monetary stimulus
was taken to support aggregate demand and to return inflation to the target by
the end of 2005. The Bank will monitor closely the evolution of external and
domestic demand and the pressures on inflation, as the economy adjusts to
global changes.
