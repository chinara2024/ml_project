MONETARY POLICY REPORT
UPDATE
– July 2006 –
This text is a commentary of the Governing Council of the Bank of Canada.
It presents the Bank’s updated outlook based on information
received up to 11 July 2006.
Overview
Overall,
the
outlook
for
economic
growth and inflation in Canada is largely
unchanged from that set out in the April
Monetary Policy Report. Growth in the first
half of 2006 appears to have been a little
stronger, and the Canadian dollar has trad-
ed in a higher range than envisaged in the
last Report. As well, there was a further shift
in the composition of demand towards con-
sumption and away from exports. This ad-
ditional strength in domestic demand is
expected to persist into next year, but it
should be more than offset by a weaker out-
look for net exports, owing primarily to the
recent strength in the Canadian dollar.
Hence, in aggregate, growth in 2007–08 is
expected to be a little weaker than projected
in April.
The economy is currently judged to be
operating just above its production capaci-
ty. With some anticipated moderation in
U.S. economic growth, combined with past
interest rate and exchange rate increases,
the Canadian economy is projected to re-
turn to its production capacity by the end of
2008. The Bank projects real GDP growth of
3.2 per cent in 2006, 2.9 per cent in 2007, and
2.8 per cent in 2008.
Total CPI inflation is expected to aver-
age just over 1 1/2 per cent from mid-2006
to mid-2007, with the reduction in the
Goods and Services Tax (GST) lowering the
inflation rate by 0.6 percentage points over
this period. Inflation should then return to
the 2 per cent target and remain there. Up-
ward pressure on inflation from excess de-
mand
in
the
economy
is
offset
by
downward pressure from the declining
prices of many imported consumer goods.
Highlights
• Overall, the outlook for growth and
inﬂation in Canada is largely unchanged
from April.
• While growth in the ﬁrst half of 2006
appears to have been a little stronger,
growth in 2007–08 is expected to be a little
weaker, owing primarily to the lagged
effects of the higher dollar.
• Total CPI inﬂation should average just
over 1 1/2 per cent until mid-2007 and
then return to the 2 per cent target.
• Risks to the Bank’s projection remain
roughly balanced, with a small tilt to the
downside later in the projection period.
• The current level of the policy interest rate
is judged at this time to be consistent with
achieving the inﬂation target.

Core inflation (which excludes the effect of
changes in indirect taxes, as well as eight of
the most volatile CPI components) should
remain at about 2 per cent throughout the
projection period.
Since the April Report, world economic
developments have generally been in line
with our base-case assumption of an order-
ly resolution of global imbalances. Some
rotation in global demand is becoming evi-
dent, with stronger domestic demand in
Europe and Japan, weaker consumption in
the United States, and some further real ef-
fective depreciation of the U.S. dollar.
There are important upside and down-
side risks to the projection, but the Bank
continues to judge that these risks are rough-
ly balanced. The upside risks to Canadian
output and inflation relate primarily to the
momentum in household spending and
housing prices. The main downside risk for
Canada is that the U.S. economy could
slow more rapidly than expected, reducing
demand for Canadian exports. Because of
the possibility of a disorderly resolution of
global current account imbalances, the bal-
ance of risks is tilted slightly to the down-
side later in the projection period.
The Bank of Canada raised the target
for the overnight rate by 25 basis points to
4.25 per cent in late May. On 11 July, the
target rate was left unchanged (Chart 1).
The current level of the policy rate is
judged, at this time, to be consistent with
achieving the inflation target over the me-
dium term. The Bank will monitor global
and domestic economic and financial de-
velopments, including adjustments in the
Canadian economy, relative to its projection.
Recent Economic and Financial
Developments
Global Developments
The global economic expansion re-
mains robust, with growth in China and
the euro zone over the past few months
slightly stronger than expected.
Economic activity in the United States
is unfolding largely as anticipated. Real
GDP growth has been strong over the past
year, growing faster than potential output
on average. The U.S. economy appears to
be operating close to its potential, and re-
cent indicators suggest that real GDP growth
is moderating, particularly growth in resi-
dential investment and consumer spending.
Measures of inflation in the United States
have moved slightly higher than expected,
apparently reflecting a stronger response to
continued strong growth, the cumulative in-
crease in commodity prices, and the sizable
real effective depreciation of the U.S. dollar
since 2002.
Financial and Commodity Markets
In response to the evolving global situ-
ation, a number of major central banks
have continued to tighten their monetary
policy since the April Report. The U.S. Fed-
eral Reserve and the European Central
Bank, among others, have raised their re-
spective policy rates. The Bank of Japan has
continued to gradually exit its quantitative
easing policy.
Partly associated with the global rise in
interest rates, equity markets in many coun-
tries declined in the past few months. How-
ever, the largest declines in prices occurred
in markets that had experienced significant
gains in the first four months of 2006. Vola-
tility in markets rose but has since subsided.

Despite the substantial swings in the
prices of metals and other commodities, the
overall level of commodity prices at mid-
2006 remained at about the level expected
at the time of the last Report. Since that Re-
port, the Canadian dollar has moved up
against the U.S. dollar into a range of about
88.5 to 91.5 cents U.S. from a range of about
85.5 to 88.5 cents U.S.
Canadian Economic Activity
Canada’s real GDP appears to have
grown a little faster than expected in the first
half of 2006. The economy continued to ad-
just to global developments that included
continuing high prices for many of the com-
modities that Canada exports and a strong
Canadian dollar.
Real GDP rose at an annual rate of
3.8 per cent in the first quarter of 2006,
higher than the 3.2 per cent expected in the
April Report. Final domestic demand re-
mained the major contributor to GDP
growth (Chart 2).
The Bank’s monitoring of available in-
formation points to real GDP growth of
about 3.2 per cent in the second quarter, as
previously anticipated. Monthly informa-
tion indicates that consumer spending has
been growing faster than expected as a re-
sult of further substantial increases in em-
ployment, real personal disposable income,
and household net worth. This development

is also consistent with continued strong
growth in household credit. This additional
strength in consumer spending appears to
have been offset by greater-than-projected
weakness in merchandise export volumes
during the same period.
Pressures on Capacity
The stronger economic growth in the
first half of the year means that, at mid-
year, the level of activity and the estimated
degree of pressure on production capacity
are marginally higher than projected in the
April Report.
The Bank’s conventional measure of
the output gap, which is surrounded by a
wide confidence interval, suggests that the
economy was operating about 0.4 per cent
above its production potential in the sec-
ond quarter. In the Bank’s summer Busi-
ness Outlook Survey, the percentage of
companies reporting difficulties in meeting
an unanticipated increase in demand re-
mained above average (Chart 3).
The
employment-to-population
ratio
reached a record high in May 2006, and the
unemployment rate fell to its lowest level
since the mid-1970s. This tightness in la-
bour markets is, however, less evident in
wage developments. The underlying trend
in wage increases has fluctuated between
3 per cent and 4 per cent over the past year
and, with trend productivity growth close
to 1 3/
4 per cent, underlying increases in
unit labour costs appear to be about 2 per
cent.
After reviewing all the indicators of
capacity pressures, it is the Governing
Council’s judgment that the economy was
operating just above its production capaci-
ty in the second quarter of 2006.
Inﬂation and the 2 Per Cent Target
The 12-month rate of increase in the to-
tal CPI continued to be above the Bank’s
2 per cent inflation-control target, averag-
ing 2.6 per cent in April and May of 2006
 MONETARY POLICY REPORT UPDATE: JULY 2006

(Chart 4). Once again, this resulted mainly
from substantial increases in energy prices
at the consumer level.
In contrast, the core rate of inflation re-
mained below 2 per cent in the first four
monthsof2006,beforemovingupto2percent
in May—slightly sooner than expected. The
rateofincreaseinthepriceofshelterforhome-
owners has picked up since early this year be-
cause of higher prices for new housing. The
rate of increase in the prices of other services
has also strengthened. At the same time, the
prices of many import-intensive goods have
continued to come under downward pressure
from decreases in the world prices of many
manufactured goods and from the past appre-
ciation of the Canadian dollar.

The Economic Outlook
The Bank’s base-case projection as-
sumes energy prices consistent with
current futures prices, as well as a smooth
and orderly resolution of global imbal-
ances, resulting from supportive policy
actions to rebalance global demand com-
bined with a gradual real effective depreci-
ation of the U.S. dollar.
Global economic growth in 2006 is now
expected to be 4.9 per cent, slightly strong-
er than the 4.8 per cent anticipated at the
time of the last Report. The current momen-
tum in global economic activity is projected
to ease gradually, with global economic
growth slowing to 4.6 per cent in 2007 and
4.4 per cent in 2008, more in line with
growth in world production potential.
Consistent with the April Report, real
GDP growth in the United States is expect-
ed to average 3.5 per cent in 2006, before
moderating to a rate close to potential
growth of about 3.2 per cent in 2007 and
2008. Housing activity and growth in con-
sumption are projected to slow as part of a
rotation in the source of growth away from
domestic demand and towards exports.
Prices for crude oil futures over the
projection period are slightly higher than
those in the April Report, averaging just
over US$74 per barrel, while those for nat-
ural gas are somewhat lower.
The price index for non-energy com-
modities is expected to ease over the projec-
tion period from the high levels reached in
the second quarter of 2006, largely as a re-
sult of declines in metals prices as increases
in world supply become more evident.
Nevertheless, the projected level of non-
energy commodity prices remains high
relative to historical experience.
The Bank’s base-case projection for eco-
nomic growth in Canada is 3.2 per cent in
2006, 2.9 per cent in 2007, and 2.8 per cent
in 2008 (Chart 5, Table 1). While this overall
outlook for growth is largely unchanged
from that in the April Report, it is a little
 MONETARY POLICY REPORT UPDATE: JULY 2006

stronger in 2006 and a little lower in 2007
and 2008. The slower growth stems from
the assumption that the Canada-U.S. ex-
change rate will stay in its recent higher
range over the projection period. In addi-
tion, the projected composition of growth
has
changed
somewhat
since
April
(Table 1). Stronger growth in consumption
spending is offset by a weaker outlook for
net exports.
Strong domestic demand in Canada,
supported by robust global growth, re-
mains a key feature of the base-case projec-
tion. Business investment and consumer
spending are expected to remain strong,
while spending on housing, after rising
considerably in 2006, is expected to decline
slightly in 2007 and 2008. Government ex-
penditures on goods, services, and trans-
fers are assumed to increase broadly in line
with revenues over the projection period,
adding to the strength of domestic demand.
While exports are expected to contin-
ue to increase, reflecting the strength in
global demand, export growth is now pro-
jected to make a more modest contribution
to growth owing to the assumption that
the exchange rate remains in its current
range. At the same time, further marked
gains in investment in machinery and
equipment, combined with the strength in

the Canadian dollar, should stimulate im-
ports. Thus, net exports are expected to ex-
ert a drag on overall growth for some time,
though this effect should diminish over the
projection period.
The assumption for potential output
growth continues to be 2.9 per cent in 2006
and 3.0 per cent in 2007 and 2008.1 This
growth profile implies that the economy
would remain in slight excess demand over
the remainder of 2006, before returning to
its production capacity by the end of 2008.
1.
Since the April Report, Statistics Canada has revised up its
estimates of labour productivity growth for 2005, giving the
Bank greater conﬁdence in its assumption of 1 3/4 per cent for
trend productivity growth and 3 per cent for potential output
growth.

In this base-case projection, the anticipated
moderation of U.S. growth, combined with
the lagged effects of past interest rate and
exchange rate increases, brings aggregate
supply and demand back into balance.
Hence, in this projection, the current level
of the policy interest rate is consistent with
achieving the 2 per cent inflation target.
Movements in the 12-month rate of in-
crease in total CPI inflation will be impor-
tantly influenced by the cut in the GST from
7 per cent to 6 per cent on 1 July 2006 and
by developments in the markets for crude
oil and natural gas. The direct effect of the
one-percentage-point cut in the GST on
the total CPI is estimated to be 0.6 per cent.
Total CPI inflation is expected to average
just over 1 1/2 per cent in the second half
of 2006 and the first half of 2007, before re-
turning to the 2 per cent target (Table 2).
Note that total CPI inflation is likely to fall
temporarily to close to 1 per cent this Sep-
tember, reflecting the brief surge in energy
prices last September.
Core inflation is expected to remain at
about 2 per cent throughout the projection
period. The upward pressure on inflation
from
excess
demand
in
the
economy
should be offset by continued downward
pressure from further reductions in the pric-
es of manufactured goods. These two off-
setting factors are projected to diminish in
tandem over the projection period, with the
result that the core rate should stay at 2 per
cent.
