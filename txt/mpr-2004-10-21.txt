CANADA’S INFLATION-CONTROL STRATEGY
Inflation control and the economy
• Inflation control is not an end in itself; it is the means whereby monetary
policy contributes to solid economic performance.
• Low inflation allows the economy to function more effectively. This con-
tributes to better economic growth over time and works to moderate
cyclical fluctuations in output and employment.
The monetary policy instrument
• Announcements regarding the Bank’s policy instrument—the target over-
night interest rate—take place, under normal circumstances, on eight pre-
specified dates during the year.
• In setting a target for the overnight rate, the Bank of Canada influences
short-term interest rates to achieve a rate of monetary expansion consis-
tent with the inflation-control target. The transmission mechanism is com-
plex and involves long and variable lags—the impact on inflation from
changes in policy rates is usually spread over six to eight quarters.
The targets
• In February 1991, the federal government and the Bank of Canada jointly
announced a series of targets for reducing total CPI inflation to the mid-
point of a range of 1 to 3 per cent by the end of 1995. That inflation-con-
trol target range was extended a number of times, most recently in May
2001, in this last case to the end of 2006. Monetary policy will continue to
aim at keeping future inflation at the 2 per cent target midpoint of this
range, both to maximize the likelihood that inflation stays within the tar-
get range and to increase the predictability of inflation over the longer
term (Crawford 2001).
Monitoring inflation
• In the short run, a good deal of movement in the CPI is caused by transi-
tory fluctuations in the prices of such volatile components as fruit and
gasoline, as well as by changes in indirect taxes. For this reason, the Bank
focuses on a core measure of CPI inflation that excludes the eight most vol-
atile components of the CPI and adjusts the remaining components to
remove the effect of changes in indirect taxes. Core inflation also tends to
be a better predictor of future changes in the total CPI than does the recent
history of CPI inflation (Macklem 2001).

This is a report of the Governing Council of the Bank of Canada:
David Dodge, Paul Jenkins, Sheryl Kennedy, Pierre Duguay,
David Longworth, and Mark Carney.
We can be certain that . . . powerful global eco-
nomic forces . . . will continue to be felt as the
world economy continues to evolve. This evolu-
tion will lead to challenges that we must face,
but it will also lead to opportunities that we
must seize.
At the Bank of Canada, we will continue to
monitor these global forces closely and assess
their impact at home and abroad. This will help
us contribute to Canada’s future economic pros-
pects through low and stable inflation.

1. OVERVIEW
The Canadian economy continues to adjust to major global
developments. These include a marked recovery in world eco-
nomic growth and an associated increase in commodity prices; the
growing global presence of major emerging-market economies
such as China and India; and a realignment of world currencies,
including the Canadian dollar. Canadian monetary policy is facili-
tating the adjustment by aiming to keep inflation at its 2 per cent
target and the economy operating near its production capacity.
Early in the year, with core inflation below target and excess
supply in the economy, the Bank lowered its target for the over-
night interest rate to 2 per cent to support growth in domestic
demand. Given the appreciation of the Canadian dollar in 2003,
the Bank did not expect net exports (the difference between
exports and imports) to make a material contribution to growth in
aggregate demand in 2004 and 2005. But, in fact, in the first half of
this year, exports grew much more vigorously than anticipated. As
a result, the Canadian economy has moved up near its production
capacity sooner than was projected in either the April Monetary
Policy Report or the July Update.
Recent developments have reinforced the continuing need for
economic adjustments in Canada. Largely reflecting the strength
of global demand, world oil prices have risen well above the
Bank’s earlier assumptions. The prices of non-energy commodities
are at high levels, and the Canadian dollar has strengthened fur-
ther, which places additional pressure on some sectors that are
highly exposed to international trade.
Over the period to the end of 2006, the Bank’s base-case pro-
jection is for aggregate demand for Canadian goods and services to
expand, on average, at about the same rate as potential output,
which is estimated at 3 per cent. Given the effects of higher oil
prices and the past appreciation of the Canadian dollar, the Bank
projects growth to be slightly less than 3 per cent in 2005 and
slightly more than 3 per cent in 2006.
With the economy expected to remain near its production
capacity throughout the projection period, core inflation is pro-
jected to move back up to 2 per cent by the end of 2005.
Against this background, the Bank moved to reduce the
amount of monetary stimulus in the economy by raising its target
for the overnight rate to 2.25 per cent on 8 September and to
2.50 per cent on 19 October (Chart 1). Further reduction of monetary
stimulus will be required over time to keep inflation on target,

with the pace of interest rate increases depending on the Bank’s
continuing assessment of the prospects for factors that affect pres-
sures on capacity and, hence, inflation.
The outlook for Canadian exports and imports is of particular
significance in this respect, given the uncertainty associated with
the ongoing adjustments to changes in the global economy, includ-
ing changes in commodity prices and exchange rates. The risks
surrounding global economic prospects relate primarily to the
evolution of oil prices, the pace of expansion in China, the way in
which current account imbalances in the United States and East
Asia will be resolved, and geopolitical developments.

2. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN INFLATION
Core
CPI inflation averaged 1.5 per cent in the first eight
months of 2004, below the Bank’s 2 per cent inflation-control tar-
get. At the same time, unexpectedly high prices for crude oil have
contributed to a marked rise in the rate of increase in the total CPI.
Inflation and the 2 per cent target
Core inflation remained
below the 2 per cent target
in August.
The core rate of inflation was 1.5 per cent in August, up
from 1.1 per cent last February (Chart 2).1 Other measures of the
trend rate of inflation that the Bank follows were also below the
2 per cent target (Chart 3).
The slack in product markets, which had been evident through
most of 2003 and into early 2004, contributed to keeping the core
rate of inflation below the 2 per cent target through the first eight
months of this year. The prices of import-intensive goods also con-
tinued to decline in the first eight months of 2004 as a result of
further reductions in world prices for many consumer goods and
the impact of the earlier rise in the Canadian dollar. Despite some
volatility in intervening months, the overall rise in the core rate

of the CPI and adjusts the remaining components to remove the effect of
changes in indirect taxes. The eight most volatile components are fruit, vege-
tables, gasoline, fuel oil, natural gas, intercity transportation, tobacco, and
mortgage-interest costs.

between February and August was about as projected in both the
April Report and the July Update. With motor vehicle prices higher
than expected, core inflation increased somewhat more than antic-
ipated in the period from March to July. But in August, the core
rate of inflation moved back into line with expectations, following
renewed discounting of automobile prices. The 12-month rate of
increase in consumer meat prices has also risen markedly in recent
months, partly reﬂecting a reduced supply of chicken resulting from
an outbreak of avian influenza in British Columbia’s Fraser
Valley.2
The rate of increase in the
total CPI has risen mark-
edly since last February.
The 12-month rate of increase in the total CPI was 1.9 per cent
in August, up from 0.7 per cent in February. This larger gain rela-
tive to the core rate was caused mainly by substantial increases in
the consumer prices of gasoline and fuel oil from their levels a
year earlier. The price of crude oil has continued to rise since mid-
April, reflecting strong global demand for oil and heightened con-
cerns about the risks of supply disruptions in a number of oil-
producing regions (Technical Box 1). Indeed, the price of oil is
currently well above the levels in the base-case scenarios of both
the April Report and the last Update.
2. It also reflected a recovery in consumer beef prices from the unusually low
levels recorded in August 2003, following the closure of international borders
to imports of Canadian cattle, beef, and related products as a result of the dis-
covery of an isolated case of bovine spongiform encephalopathy in Alberta.

Recent Movements in Oil Prices
Crude oil prices have increased by more than 50 per cent since the beginning of
this year, reaching a record high in October. Nevertheless, the peak oil price, in real
terms, was still about 20 per cent below the historical peak reached in the second
quarter of 1981. The recent unexpected rise in global oil prices has reflected both a
substantial increase in the demand for oil, as world growth strengthened more than
anticipated, and heightened uncertainty regarding potential disruptions to oil sup-
plies, at a time of exceptionally low global spare capacity.
A repeated ratcheting up of actual and expected global demand during 2004 has
underpinned the perception of a tighter oil market and the subsequent rise in price.
The International Energy Agency’s (IEA) estimate of world demand for crude oil in
2004, which stood at 80.3 million barrels per day (bpd) in April, has been raised to
82.4 million bpd. Robust economic growth in China and India has contributed to this
marked rise in demand.
Spare capacity in OPEC-member countries (excluding Iraq), the only significant
source of incremental short-term supply besides commercial oil stocks, is estimated to
have touched record lows this year. In these circumstances, supply threats have had a
particularly strong impact on prices by boosting the demand for inventories as a pre-
caution against major supply disruptions. Concern about the security of oil produc-
tion in the Middle East (particularly in Iraq), uncertainty surrounding Yukos Oil
Company’s production in Russia, recent political instability in Nigeria, and significant
damage to oil production facilities in the Gulf of Mexico have all contributed to higher
prices.
Prices of West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures suggest that prices are likely
to remain at high levels in the near term, because of strong demand, low spare capac-
ity, and supply threats. In the medium term, the global supply of crude oil should
expand to meet higher demand, bringing prices gradually down. This is reflected in
medium-term forward prices. The six-year forward price is currently US$38.30 per
barrel.

Factors at work on inflation
Aggregate demand
In the first half of 2004,
economic growth in
Canada was higher
than projected . . .
Canada’s real GDP advanced at an annual rate of 3.7 per cent
in the first half of 2004, higher than that projected in the last
Report (Chart 4). In particular, the increase in exports was signifi-
cantly stronger than expected. Recent indicators for spending and
activity suggest that economic growth was about 3 per cent in the
third quarter of 2004, marginally less than anticipated in the
July Update.
. . . with exports surging
and household spending
also rising markedly.
The broadly based surge in exports reflected continued strong
growth in global economic activity, as well as a recovery from the
unusually low level in mid-2003. Final domestic demand also rose
considerably, especially at the beginning of the year (Chart 5).
Household spending continued to increase at a robust pace
because of past monetary stimulus and stronger gains in real
incomes (Chart 6). Capital expenditures by businesses also rose
substantially. Some of this increased demand was met by imports,
although imports rose much less than exports. Since part of the
increase in sales was likely unexpected by firms, inventories were
also reduced.
Growth in the U.S. economy slowed to 3.3 per cent (at annual
rates) in the second quarter of 2004 from 4.5 per cent in the first
quarter, owing to weaker growth in consumption. Higher oil
prices were mainly responsible for dampening consumption,

which is expected to rebound modestly in the third quarter.3 Evi-
dence to date indicates that growth rose to about 4.5 per cent in
the third quarter (Chart 7).

sales, fuelled by dealer incentives.

Adjusting to Global Change
The marked recovery in
the global demand for
Canadian goods and
services has offset the
effect of a stronger
Canadian dollar . . .
Canadian producers continue to adjust to developments in the
global economy. These developments include a marked recovery
in world economic growth; the associated increase in commodity
prices; the growing global presence of major emerging-market
economies, such as China and India; and large movements in the
U.S. dollar against most other major currencies, including the
Canadian
dollar.
The
impact
of
these
developments
on
the
demand for Canadian goods and services is causing changes in
the composition of activity, employment, and capital spending
among the various sectors of the economy, as well as major adjust-
ments by many firms. Indeed, many companies in industries that
are highly exposed to international competition are making signif-
icant modifications to their operations.4
. . . and boosted output in
most industries highly
exposed to foreign
competition.
Between December 2003 and July 2004, output growth in Can-
ada remained strong in those sectors with low exposure to inter-
national trade. Over the same period, however, the strength of
global demand for Canadian goods and services has also led to
sharply higher output in a number of industries highly exposed to
international competition (Technical Box 2).
Business capital spending and intentions have also been
importantly
affected
by
key
global
economic
developments.

Adjusting to Global Change: An Update of Sectoral Developments in Canada1
Since the end of 2003, the impact of the global economic recovery on the demand
for Canadian goods and services has become much more apparent. The strong recov-
ery in exports in the first half of 2004 appears to have derived mainly from the global
economic upswing and the accompanying rise in commodity prices. Exports also ben-
efited from a shift in the composition of foreign activity in favour of components to
which Canadian exports are particularly sensitive and from the diminishing effects of
earlier unfavourable sectoral shocks.2 Consequently, output growth in sectors highly
exposed to international trade increased strongly, despite the appreciation of the
Canadian dollar. In particular, production in industries manufacturing non-electrical
machinery, chemical products, and fabricated metal products rose sharply. Continued
substantial growth in Canada’s final domestic demand during the first half of this
year also contributed to further gains in activity in most sectors with a low exposure
to international competition, especially in telecommunications services and retail
trade.
There have been marked fluctuations in profitability among sectors in Canada
since the end of 2002. Although aggregate profitability was high in 2003, the average
rate of return on equity in sectors highly exposed to international trade worsened con-
siderably between the first and third quarters of 2003. Companies in sectors where
prices are determined in world markets (and denominated in U.S. dollars) quickly
experienced the adverse effect of the Canadian dollar’s appreciation on their profita-
bility. Subsequently, with stronger output growth and substantial increases in world
prices for commodities, profitability in most of these sectors had recovered considera-
bly by mid-2004. The increase in profitability has been especially pronounced for
manufacturers of automobiles and parts; chemicals, plastics, and rubber products; and
wood and paper products.
Even so, because many companies in industries highly exposed to international
trade had experienced weakness in their profitability over most of the period since
2001, they have continued to make adjustments since the end of 2003. For instance,
there has been relatively little change in employment in the manufacturing sector
since the end of last year, despite a marked rise in production. As well, capital spend-
ing in many industries with a high exposure to international competition (other than
those
producing
energy
and
other
commodities)
has
decreased
considerably
since 2002.

Indeed, the growth of business investment since 2002 has been
concentrated in sectors with low exposure to international compe-
tition, as well as in industries producing energy and other com-
modities. In the remaining industries that are highly exposed to
international trade and, therefore, to exchange rate fluctuations,
capital spending has fallen back, however.
The Bank’s autumn Business Outlook Survey suggested that, over-
all, the level of conﬁdence among ﬁrms about sales prospects over
the next 12 months remains about as high as it was in the summer
survey, with ﬁrms in the West being signiﬁcantly more optimistic
than those in Central and Eastern Canada. Optimism about prospec-
tive capital spending also continues to be fairly high. Firms in most
sectors still plan to increase their investment expenditures, with man-
ufacturing continuing to be an exception.
More generally, it appears that many Canadian firms are still
adjusting to developments in the global economy. Indeed, with
continuing uncertainty attached to the outlook for global demand
for Canadian goods and services, the likely path of world prices
for energy and non-energy commodities, and the nature and
extent of further changes in currencies, the size and timing of fur-
ther adjustments by Canadian businesses remains uncertain.
Estimated pressures on capacity
Activity in the Canadian
economy had moved up
near its production poten-
tial by the second quarter
of 2004.
Canada’s economic growth in the first half of 2004 was higher
than projected in the April Report. This, combined with a small
upward revision to real GDP data for 2003,5 suggests that the Cana-
dian economy has moved up near its production potential some-
what more quickly than was expected in the last Report. Indeed,
the Bank’s conventional measures of potential output and the out-
put gap indicate that the level of economic activity was very close
to full capacity by the second quarter of 2004 (Chart 8). While
there continues to be a wide confidence interval surrounding any
estimate of the output gap, the Bank believes that its conventional
measure provides a balanced assessment of how close the econ-
omy is to its capacity limits. This is confirmed by the proportion
of firms reporting pressures on capacity in the Bank’s autumn
Business Outlook Survey (Chart 9).
Some indicators currently point to greater pressure on capacity
than the conventional measure. For instance, capacity utilization in the
non-farm, goods-producing sector was well above the 2000–03 average.
As well, the number of companies adversely affected by labour
shortages rose from the summer Business Outlook Survey. These

basis, was revised up to 2.0 per cent from an initial estimate of 1.7 per cent.

labour shortages were widespread in the resource, trucking, busi-
ness and personal services, manufacturing, and construction sec-
tors. This last shortage is consistent with the capacity pressures
that have been evident in the housing market for some time.

In contrast, other indicators suggest more slack than implied
by the conventional measure of the output gap. Hours worked
have been below trend, and wage increases continue to be moder-
ate. The ratio of unfilled orders to shipments in the manufacturing
sector (excluding aerospace products and parts) also remains quite
low.
There are differences in capacity utilization across industries
and regions, and some of these differences may well become more
pronounced in the future as a result of the ongoing adjustment
process to global changes. However, there is currently little excess
supply in the Canadian economy as a whole.
Cost control and output prices
Unit labour costs in the
second quarter of 2004
were up only modestly
from year-earlier levels.
Unit labour costs in the business sector in the second quarter
of 2004 were up modestly from year-earlier levels, even though
productivity increased only slightly over the past year (Chart 10).
This reflected the fact that hourly labour compensation in the
business sector rose by a mere 1 per cent between the second
quarter of 2003 and the second quarter of 2004. However, the under-
lying rate of increase in wages, based on such measures as the average
hourly earnings of permanent workers,6 seems to have been in a
range between 2 1/4 and 3 1/4 per cent since the fourth quarter
of 2003 (Chart 11).7
Further large year-over-year increases in the prices of Canada’s
commodity exports during the first half of 2004, resulting from
strong growth in the world economy, contributed importantly to
the pronounced increase in the annual rise in the chain price index
for GDP (a broad price measure of goods and services produced in
Canada) between the fourth quarter of 2003 and the second quar-
ter of 2004 (Chart 12). However, the prices of non-energy com-
modities have edged down slightly since mid-2004 (Chart 13).
Upward revisions to forecasts for U.S. crop production contrib-
uted to a decline in grain prices, and the prices of forest products
have also eased as a result of somewhat weaker demand. In con-
trast, strong world demand has led to firmness in metals prices.
6. The average hourly earnings of permanent workers for the aggregate econ-
omy appear to give a better indication of the underlying rate of increase in
wages than does labour compensation per person-hour in the business sector,
partly because they are considerably less volatile. As well, the labour-
compensation measure has, at times, been subject to considerable revision.
7. The drop in the average base-wage rate for contracts negotiated in the pub-
lic sector in the second quarter of 2004 reﬂected the impact of a Government
of British Columbia contract with health sector workers that contained wage
cuts. The decrease in the average base-wage rate for contracts negotiated in
the private sector in July 2004 reﬂected the impact of Air Canada agreements
that contained wage freezes and some wage reductions.

3. FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Financial conditions have
been very favourable.
Financial conditions in Canada have been very favourable
since the April Report. The yields and spreads on corporate bonds
are broadly unchanged and remain below their historical aver-
ages, as strong profitability offsets concerns about the possible
impact of higher interest rates in the future (Chart 14). Canadian
equity markets have moved higher since the time of the last
Report, and remain well above the levels seen a year ago. The solid
earnings performance of Canadian banks, together with increased
competition among financial institutions and between financial
institutions and capital markets for business lending, has contrib-
uted to easier bank-lending conditions.
Favourable financial conditions and ongoing improvements in
business balance sheets have led to a strengthening of total busi-
ness credit growth, which is approaching a level in line with its
historical averages (Chart 15). There has been a particularly brisk
pickup in short-term business credit over the past few months—
largely in the form of loans from chartered banks. This increase
was due to lower borrowing costs, easier terms and conditions,
and a slight increase in the demand for credit. Long-term business
credit continued to grow solidly, supported by healthy issuance of
bonds and equities in capital markets. However, most of the
increase in business credit seems to have been directed towards
general business operations rather than increased investment.

Household credit advanced at an accelerated pace, with both
consumer credit and residential mortgage credit contributing to the
rise. This pickup suggests that low interest rates and solid income
growth are still bolstering consumption and housing investment.
Yields on shorter-term bonds in both Canada and the United
States have risen since the last Report, driven by higher policy
rates and expectations of further increases. Yields on longer-term
bonds, in contrast, have shifted down slightly (Chart 16). Further-
more, bond yields are generally well below the peaks reached in
May and June of this year. The early summer peak in yields

reflected both the perceived beginning of the tightening phase in
the U.S. interest rate cycle and growing optimism about the
strength of the U.S. and global recoveries. Subsequent concerns
over the summer months about a U.S. slowdown, combined with
record high oil prices and the dampening effect that they could
have on consumption in several countries, have led to a sharp
drop in yields from those earlier levels. Spreads between the
yields on Canadian and U.S. government bonds have generally
widened over the period, largely as a result of movements in U.S.
yields.
Although the Canadian dollar also exhibited significant move-
ments over the period, it is broadly stronger since the time of the
last Report, having appreciated by slightly over 7 per cent relative
to both the U.S. dollar and the C-5 index of currencies (Chart 17).
By mid-May, when the growth outlook in the United States was at
its most optimistic, the Canadian dollar had fallen to approxi-
mately 71.5 cents U.S. Following this, however, a combination of
weaker-than-expected U.S. growth, stronger Canadian growth,
and firming commodity prices contributed to the appreciation of
the Canadian dollar, which is currently trading at close to 80 cents U.S.

4. THE OUTLOOK
International background
The global economy is expected to continue to expand over the
next two years, fuelled by robust growth in Asia, somewhat above
potential growth in the United States, and moderate growth in
Europe and Japan (Table 1). The pace of expansion will be damp-
ened by the recent sharp increase in oil prices, however, and by a
move to higher interest rates as economies currently experiencing
excess supply conditions move closer to full production capacity.
The Bank’s base-case projection calls for world economic growth
to moderate from about 4 3/4 per cent in 2004 to about 4 per cent
in 2005, and to pick up to about 4 1/4 per cent in 2006.
While the outlook is favourable, there are a number of uncer-
tainties, especially beyond mid-2005. The timing and extent of fis-
cal consolidation in most major economies is unclear at this time.
More broadly, the form of the resolution of current account imbal-
ances, notably those in the United States and East Asia, is difficult
to ascertain. And there remain ongoing geopolitical concerns.

Over the next two and a half years, the Bank’s base-case pro-
jection for the U.S. economy is for growth at a rate slightly faster
than that of its production capacity. The key economic driver in
the United States is expected to be strong growth in business
investment, responding to underinvestment in recent years and to
very favourable ﬁnancing conditions. Productivity gains from past
and future investments and capital deepening are expected to main-
tain the growth of potential output at about 3 1/2 per cent. The
past depreciation of the U.S. dollar should boost net exports,
while the recent sharp increase in oil prices, together with a reduc-
tion in monetary stimulus, and some assumed fiscal consolidation,
will dampen growth in household spending. The output gap, esti-
mated at 1 per cent in the third quarter of 2004, is projected to narrow
further during 2006.
In Europe, the recovery, although uneven, is now somewhat
more firmly anchored. Robust growth in some countries, such as
the United Kingdom, is counterbalanced by less-favourable pros-
pects in Germany and Italy. The recovery in Japan is expected to
be sustained, albeit at a slower pace than recorded at the end of
2003 and early 2004. Emerging-market countries in Asia should
continue to contribute positively to world growth if China suc-
cessfully moves towards a more sustainable growth path.
There are risks to the outlook for 2005. On the downside, the
U.S. economy may slow more than expected, and the Chinese
economy may slow more abruptly than projected. On the upside,
investment growth and inventory rebuilding in the United States
may be stronger than expected, and the Chinese economy may not
slow as much as projected.
The U.S.-dollar prices of non-energy commodities are expected
to remain at a relatively high level over the next two years as a
result of the global economic expansion, although they are likely
to ease over time as new supplies come on stream. The price of
crude oil is assumed to remain above US$50 per barrel in the first
half of 2005 and to ease to about US$43 per barrel by the second
half of 2006. Natural gas prices, which will likely move up with
the onset of the winter heating season, are expected to remain at
relatively high levels through 2006. These assumptions are consis-
tent with the current market expectations embodied in futures
prices (Chart 18). The Bank’s base-case scenario for oil prices is
well above that used in both the last Report and Update.

Aggregate demand and supply in Canada
Continued strong growth

importantly to economic
expansion in Canada

Continued
strong
growth
of
final
domestic
demand
is
expected to contribute importantly to economic expansion in Can-
ada through to 2006 (Table 2). Business investment is projected to
strengthen further as a result of strong growth in the global
economy and the resulting high level of commodity prices, very
favourable financial conditions, and reductions in the prices of
imported machinery and equipment. Solid growth in consumer
spending should be sustained by further gains in real incomes.
Housing investment is expected to stabilize at current high levels,
as supply catches up with demand. And spending by all levels of
government is projected to rise broadly in line with revenues as
governments strive to maintain fiscal balance.
While continued global economic expansion implies further
gains for Canadian exports, this is projected to be more than offset
by faster growth in imports. The past appreciation of the Cana-
dian dollar is expected to continue to dampen the growth of Can-
ada’s exports and to boost that of imports through 2005.
However, it remains difficult to analyze Canada’s international
trade volumes in terms of the underlying fundamentals (Technical
Box 3). At mid-2003, the levels of both exports and imports
seemed well below those indicated by their historical relationships
with measures of real income and relative prices. Since then,
exports have moved back up near their predicted long-run levels,
while imports continue to be much lower than expected. These

puzzling developments, together with substantial and ongoing
revisions to the trade data, make the projection of the future con-
tribution of net exports to GDP growth particularly uncertain. More
generally, given the various forces at play in the global economy,
there are risks around our projections for imports and exports,
and for business investment.
Higher-than-expected oil prices, both actual and prospective,
should tend to reduce demand for Canadian exports, raise produc-
tion costs for Canadian firms, and dampen household spending,
all else being equal. Over time, they should also lead to higher
capital spending and output by energy-producing firms. However,
given the time necessary for regulatory approvals before major
new projects can proceed, and given tight markets for many
inputs, including skilled labour, the impact of higher oil prices on
the
capital
expenditures
of
energy-producing
companies
is
expected to be limited in the short term. Thus, higher energy
prices are likely to have a small negative effect on Canadian GDP in
the near term, before the positive impact on capital spending and
energy output in Canada becomes more pronounced.
Growth is expected to
remain close to 3 per cent
through 2006 . . .
The Bank’s base-case projection for Canada calls for real GDP
growth to average about 3 per cent (the estimated growth rate of
production capacity), at an annual rate, over the period from the
second half of 2004 to the end of 2006. Given the effects of higher
oil prices, including a slowing in U.S. economic expansion, and
the anticipated further dampening of net exports arising from the

Technical Box 3
The Dynamics of Exports and Imports
Large changes in macroeconomic variables and significant disturbances to trade
from unusual shocks, combined with ongoing high volatility and substantial revisions
to trade data, have made the interpretation of export and import movements difficult
over the last few years. Nevertheless, an analysis of recent trade data and macroeco-
nomic developments within a framework of error-correction models of exports and
imports suggests the following picture of trade adjustment.
Exports have sprung up in recent quarters after a period of trend decline that had
brought them well below the estimated long-run “fundamental” values suggested by
an econometric model based on the observed levels of foreign output, the relative
price of exports, and global openness to trade, as captured by the ratio of exports to
GDP in OECD countries. This shortfall seems ascribable, at least in part, to increasing
slack in the world economy and to a number of unfavourable sector-specific develop-
ments.1 The recent resurgence of exports appears to have arisen mostly from the glo-
bal economic upswing and the accompanying rise in commodity prices. Exports have
also probably been boosted by a shift in the composition of foreign activity in favour
of components to which Canadian exports are particularly sensitive,2 the diminishing
effects of earlier unfavourable sectoral shocks, and to a smaller degree, a decline over
the past year in manufacturing unit labour costs relative to the export price of end
products. As a result, exports had climbed back closer to their predicted long-run
value by the second quarter of this year.
Imports have been trending up in 2003 and 2004 relative to a measure of import-
intensive activity. At the same time, however, they have fallen increasingly below the
values suggested by an econometric model based on the observed levels of import-
intensive activity, the relative price of imports, and global openness to trade. Work at
a disaggregated level suggests that this shortfall originates largely in machinery and
equipment imports and that, to a small extent, it may have arisen from attempts by
industries with high propensities to import equipment parts and components to
reduce excessive stocks relative to sales. Uncertainty about the estimated parameters
of the import model allows for a range of probable values for the shortfall of imports.
Thus, the relatively large size of the estimate shown below must be interpreted with
caution.
Although it remains very hard to project with confidence how trade adjustment
will evolve in the future, it seems likely that net exports will make a negative contri-
bution to growth in the short term as exports slow more than imports. Exports might
receive less support from the factors that have counteracted exchange rate effects
recently, while imports would likely tend to catch up to higher long-run “fundamen-
tal” levels.

For instance, a measure that weights indexes of U.S. industrial production and various
components of U.S. GDP by the relative proportions in total Canadian exports of the export cat-
egories to which they relate shows signiﬁcantly more growth from the third quarter of 2003
onwards than does U.S. GDP.

past appreciation of the Canadian dollar, growth is expected to be
slightly less than 3 per cent during 2005 and slightly more in 2006.
This implies growth, on an annual average basis, of just under
3 per cent in 2004 and 2005, and about 3 1/4 per cent in 2006.
The projection for growth in 2004 is a little higher than in the
April Report and the July Update, whereas the projection for 2005 is
lower. This growth projection for 2005 is also lower than the latest
Consensus outlook.
. . . with the economy
staying close to its
production capacity.
This growth scenario implies that the Canadian economy may
experience some small renewed excess supply in 2005 before
returning close to its production capacity by mid-2006. The base-
case scenario assumes further withdrawal of monetary stimulus
over time to keep the economy near its production capacity and
achieve the inflation target.
Measures of inflation expectations
While indicators of
near-term inflation
expectations have moved
up, many longer-term
measures remain close
to 2 per cent.
While most indicators of short-term inflation expectations that
the Bank follows have moved up modestly since mid-April, many
of the key medium- and longer-term measures remain close to
2 per cent. In the regular survey reported in the autumn issue of
the Conference Board of Canada’s Index of Business Confidence,
72 per cent of respondents expected prices, in general, to rise over
the next six months at a rate of 2 per cent or less. This is a lower
percentage than reported nine months earlier. As well, while just
under 90 per cent of firms in the Bank’s autumn Business Outlook
Survey expected CPI inflation to be within a range of 1 to 3 per
cent, on average, over the next two years, 54 per cent of respond-
ents expected inflation to be in the upper part of the range. On the
other hand, the average private sector forecast for total CPI infla-
tion in both 2004 and 2005 is around 2 per cent. Consensus fore-
casts of inflation for 2006 and beyond also continue to be very
close to 2 per cent.
Other factors affecting inflation
There is a heightened risk that the recent surge in the global
prices of energy may pass through to the prices of non-energy
goods and services. Recent experience suggests that this pass-
through effect is likely to be relatively small and spread out over a
period of about two years. However, this experience may under-
state the pass-through of the recent increase in energy prices
owing to its expected persistence.
On the other hand, the appreciation of the Canadian dollar
since early 2003 is expected to continue to exert some slight
downward pressure on core inflation.

Increases in average hourly earnings of permanent workers are
expected to rise somewhat between now and 2006. At the same
time, with growth in labour productivity expected to pick up over
this period, the projected year-to-year increase in unit labour
costs, while rising, should be at or below 2 per cent through the
projection horizon.
Implications of money growth
Growth in the narrow money aggregates—M1+ and M1++—
has continued its upward trend since the last Report. Although the
pace moderated somewhat in July and August, it remains strong
on a year-over-year basis. This strength is broadly consistent with
the low interest rate environment and suggests strong output
growth in coming quarters (Chart 19).
Since the last Report, the growth of broad money—M2++— has
continued to recover from the low levels of 2003. This recovery is
attributed to the faster growth of the narrow money aggregates
and, to a lesser extent, faster growth in non-money-market mutual
funds. The stronger growth in M2++ points to a reduction in the
risk of disinflationary pressure (Chart 20).

Inflation projection
The excess supply in the Canadian economy, which was evi-
dent through most of 2003 and into early 2004, should keep core
inflation slightly below longer-run expectations over the next few
quarters. The past appreciation of the Canadian dollar is also
expected to exert a little downward pressure on the core rate
through 2005.
Core inflation is expected
to be about 1.5 per cent
for the rest of 2004 . . .
The year-over-year rate of increase in the core CPI is projected
to remain at about 1.5 per cent for the rest of this year. This out-
look incorporates larger monthly increases in the seasonally
adjusted core CPI relative to those experienced in the first eight
months of 2004, because recent price discounting for such items as
clothing and non-shelter services is expected to moderate, and
annual increases for tuition fees and property taxes are antici-
pated. In view of the volatility in the core rate observed in 2004 to
date, the level of uncertainty surrounding the near-term monitor-
ing of core inflation is somewhat higher than normal.
. . . before moving up to
the 2 per cent target by
the end of 2005.
With the economy operating near its potential over the projec-
tion period, the effects of other factors roughly cancelling each
other, and inflation expectations remaining well anchored, the core
rate of inflation is projected to move up to the 2 per cent target by
the end of 2005 and to remain at 2 per cent through 2006 (Table 3).

Total CPI inflation is
likely to move well above
the core rate and remain
there until mid-2005.
Developments in the markets for crude oil will continue to
have a crucial impact on the outlook for the 12-month rate of
increase in the total CPI (Chart 18). Based on the assumption that
the price of crude oil will remain above US$50 per barrel through
to mid-2005, total CPI inflation is likely to rise near the top of the
target range and stay there until the middle of next year. With the
WTI price of oil assumed to ease below US$50 per barrel in the
second half of 2005 and then to decrease further to US$43 per bar-
rel by the second half of 2006, total
CPI inflation should fall
sharply in the second half of next year and stay below the core
rate of inflation through 2006.

APPENDIX
Inflation Performance since May 2001
In May 2001, the Government of Canada and the Bank
announced the renewal of the inﬂation-control target for a period of
five years to the end of 2006. The Bank announced its intention to
strengthen the way in which the target arrangements would be
implemented in order to increase the predictability of inflation
over longer time horizons. Inflation performance since May 2001 is
reviewed here to assess how well this commitment has been met.
The Bank’s commitment to keep future inflation at the 2 per
cent target midpoint implies that inflation should be expected to
average 2 per cent over extended periods. Indeed, the average
annualized rate of inflation for the CPI excluding the effect of
changes in indirect taxes (CPIXT)1 has been 1.7 per cent since May 2001
(Chart A1).
With monetary policy systematically directed to moving infla-
tion to 2 per cent over a six-to-eight-quarter horizon, most out-
comes for 12-month inflation will be contained within a range of
+/-1 per cent around this target midpoint. Therefore, in Chart A1,
1. This measure is the focus here because the Bank’s policy actions do not try
to offset the ﬁrst-round effects of changes in indirect taxes. Because of
increases in tobacco taxes, the average rate of inﬂation for the total CPI was
1.9 per cent for the same period.

the range shown for May 2002 is +/-1 per cent around 2 per cent.
However, the width of the range containing the same frequency
of inflation outcomes would decline over time when the average
inflation rate is calculated over a longer period if there is no
correlation between non-overlapping 12-month inflation rates
(i.e., if deviations from target are truly random). In Chart A1, this
characteristic is shown by the diminishing distance over time
between the upper and lower bands. For more details, see Craw-
ford (2001).
Other approaches can be used to assess the predictability of
inflation over horizons longer than one year. For instance, the
annualized rate of CPIXT inflation over a two-year horizon has
been within 1 per cent of the target 95 per cent of the time since
May 2001 (Table A1). It has also been more tightly centred around
the target midpoint than in the preceding period (from December
1996 to April 2001). As a result, the average annual rates of change
measured from December 1994 for CPIXT have been very close to
2 per cent over most of the period from May 2001 to August 2004
(Chart A2).2 Correspondingly, measures of inflation expectations
over horizons of two years have remained tightly clustered
around the target midpoint.
Monetary policy cannot keep inflation at exactly 2 per cent
each month. Factors such as unexpected disturbances in aggregate
demand and supply and large changes in the prices of volatile CPI
components, such as energy, can move observed inflation above or
below the target midpoint. Nonetheless, if the conduct of mone-
tary policy is systematically focused on moving inflation towards

2. December 1995 was the ﬁrst month in which monetary policy had a target
range with a midpoint of 2 per cent for the 12-month inﬂation rate.

the target midpoint, actual outcomes should be within the target
range a high percentage of the time. Indeed, the 12-month rate of
change of the CPIXT has been within the target range just under
70 per cent of the time for the period under review, very close to
the outcome for the preceding period from December 1995 to
April 2001 (Table A2). Moreover, transitory price movements in
the volatile components of CPIXT have been mainly responsible for
the movements of the 12-month inflation rate that were outside
the target range over this period, since the core rate of inflation
has been within 1 per cent of the target midpoint only marginally
less often than in the preceding period (Table A3).3 Indeed, unusu-
ally large fluctuations in the prices of energy commodities since
May 2001 have contributed to somewhat more frequent, although
temporary, movements in the 12-month inflation rate for the CPIXT
outside the target range than was the case in the preceding period
from December 1995 to April 2001.
3. This was due to a large increase in insurance premiums between the end of
2001 and early 2003, which pushed the core rate of inﬂation temporarily
above the upper limit of the target range at the end of 2002 and early 2003.
