Monetary Policy Report
Update
July 2007
This text is a commentary of the Governing Council of the Bank of Canada.
It presents the Bank’s updated outlook based on information received up to
10 July 2007.
Overview
Economic growth and inflation in Canada in
the first half of this year have been stronger
than expected in the April Monetary Policy
Report. Final domestic demand has re-
mained the key driver of economic growth
in Canada, bolstered by firm commodity
prices. The Bank judges that the economy is
now operating further above its production
potential than was projected at the time of
the April Report. Both total CPI and core in-
flation have been higher than projected in
April and are above the 2 per cent inflation
target. Longer-term interest rates have in-
creased, and the Canadian dollar has appre-
ciated sharply, moving well above the
trading range assumed in the last Report.
The Canadian economy is now project-
ed to grow by 2.5 per cent in 2007, some-
what stronger than was expected in April,
and to grow somewhat more slowly in 2008
and 2009 than previously projected. In this
new projection, higher interest rates across
the yield curve and a higher assumed range
for the Canadian dollar of 93 to 95.5 cents
U.S. act to moderate growth in 2008 and
2009 to an average of about 2 1/2 per cent.
This brings aggregate demand and supply
back into balance in 2009.
Inflation is projected to be slightly
higher and more persistent than in the
April Report. However, as excess demand
diminishes, total CPI and core inflation should
decline to 2 per cent by early 2009. Also con-
tributing to the decline in inflation are great-
er downward pressure on import prices
related to the stronger Canadian dollar, and
continued deceleration in the pace of price in-
creases for new houses. With the direct effect of

rary easing in gasoline prices in late 2006, total
Highlights
• The Canadian economy is operating
further above its potential than was
projected in the April Report.
• The Bank projects average annual
economic growth of about 2 1/2 per cent
through 2009, with the economy returning
to its production potential in 2009.
• Inﬂation is projected to be slightly higher
than in the April Report, returning to the
2 per cent target by early 2009.
• There are both upside and downside risks
to the projection for inﬂation, and these
appear to be roughly balanced.
• In line with the Bank’s outlook, some
modest further increase in the policy rate
may be required.

inflation is projected to peak at about 3 per cent
in the fourth quarter of this year.
The Bank’s new projection for inflation is
subject to both upside and downside risks.
The main upside risk is that household de-
mand in Canada could be stronger than pro-
jected, which could attenuate the downward
pressure on inflation from lower import prices
and from the deceleration in the pace of price
increases for new houses. Higher levels of
household borrowing and broad money
growth point to this risk. On the downside,
the adjustment in the Canadian economy to
the rapid appreciation of the Canadian dollar
may dampen demand for Canadian goods
and services and reduce inflationary pres-
sures more than projected. As well, the ongo-
ing adjustment in the U.S. housing sector
could be more prolonged, and this could spill
over to the U.S. economy more broadly, fur-
ther dampening Canadian exports. Overall,
the upside and downside risks to the
Bank’s projection for inflation appear to be
roughly balanced.
In line with this outlook, the Bank of
Canada raised its key policy interest rate
to 4.5 per cent on 10 July. Some modest
further increase in the overnight rate may
be required to bring inflation back to target
over the medium term.
Recent Economic Developments
Global Developments
Economic growth outside North America
has generally been more robust than expect-
ed at the time of the April Report. Emerging-
market economies, particularly China and
India, continue to outperform expectations.
Over the past few months, the economic ex-
pansion in Europe and Japan has also been
stronger
than
anticipated,
with
further
strengthening in domestic demand.
The U.S. economy has evolved essen-
tially in line with expectations. Following a
weaker-than-anticipated first quarter, growth
looks to have rebounded in the second
quarter. Activity in the housing sector con-
tinues to decrease, but business investment
appears to be regaining momentum. More-
over, growth in household consumption has
remained firm, suggesting that there has
been no significant spillover from the ongo-
ing adjustment in the housing sector. In gen-
eral, most of the recent data have been
consistent with a return of the economy to
near potential growth, while U.S. inflation
has moderated somewhat.
With ongoing strength in global demand
and concerns about supplies, oil prices have
moved higher. Other commodity prices have
generally remained high, largely in line with
the assumptions in the April Report.
Canadian Economic Activity
In Canada, economic growth picked up
markedly in the first quarter of 2007, with
real GDP increasing at an annual rate of
3.7 per cent. This was stronger than the
2.5 per cent growth projected in the April
Report. In spite of the weak growth in the
U.S. economy in the first quarter of 2007,
Canada’s export volumes were higher than
expected. Inventory investment
was
also
higher than projected.
Final domestic demand continued to be
the key driver of economic growth in Canada
in the first quarter. Real personal disposable
income rose substantially, owing mainly to
strong growth in employment. The net
worth of households also continued to rise,
partly reflecting the impact of the strength
in Canada’s terms of trade. This was accom-
panied by further strong growth in house-
hold
credit.
These
developments
under-
pinned a considerable increase in household
spending. Furthermore, the inventory cor-
rection that had been a significant drag on
growth in the last half of 2006 was complet-
ed by early 2007.
Based on available information, real GDP
appears to have increased at an annual rate
of 2.8 per cent in the second quarter of 2007,
higher than the 2.3 per cent rate projected in
 MONETARY POLICY REPORT UPDATE: JULY 2007

the April Report. In particular, both consum-
er spending and exports showed strong mo-
mentum early in the quarter.
Estimated Pressures on Capacity
Several indicators suggest that the amount
of excess demand in the Canadian economy
increased in the second quarter of 2007 rela-
tive to that expected at the time of the April
Report. In the Bank’s latest Business Outlook
Survey, the percentage of companies report-
ing that they would have difficulty in meet-
ing an unanticipated increase in demand
rose to the highest level since mid-2000
(Chart 1). The Bank’s conventional measure
of the output gap indicates that the econo-
my was operating about 0.6 per cent above
its production capacity in the second quar-
ter of 2007, noticeably higher than projected
in the April Report.1
A number of indicators continue to sug-
gest tightness in labour markets, and meas-
ures
of
underlying
labour
costs
have
increased somewhat. The employment-to-
population ratio is at a record high, and the
unemployment rate is at a 33-year low.
However, the percentage of firms reporting
labour shortages in the recent Business Out-
look Survey declined.
After reviewing all the indicators of ca-
pacity pressures, the Governing Council
judges that, overall, the economy was operat-
ing about half a per cent above its production
capacity in the second quarter of 2007.
Inﬂation and the 2 Per Cent Target
Inflation has been higher than projected
in the April Report and the January Update.
This is consistent with evidence of greater
excess demand in the Canadian economy. It
also reflects some relative price movements.
1.
The estimated level of excess demand in the second quarter of
2007 is close to 0.5 percentage points higher than projected in the
April Report. This increase reﬂects a rise in the projected level
of real GDP in the second quarter of about 0.25 per cent and a
decrease in the estimated level of production capacity of about
0.2 per cent, largely reﬂecting ongoing weakness in labour
productivity.
The 12-month rate of increase in the to-
tal CPI moved up from 1.8 per cent in the
first quarter of 2007 to 2.2 per cent in April
and May (Chart 2). This higher-than-pro-
jected rise in the total CPI resulted from the
higher-than-expected core rate of inflation
and from further increases in the prices of
some of the volatile components. Gasoline
prices were higher, chiefly because of refin-
ery closures and unexpected strength in de-
mand. Fruit and vegetable prices were also
higher.

The core rate of inflation averaged
2.4 per cent in April and May, 0.2 percent-
age points higher than projected for the sec-
ond quarter in the April Report. The rate of
increase in the prices for core services ex-
cluding shelter has risen, reflecting strong
demand pressures. Prices and markups for
clothing and other semi-durable goods have
also been higher than expected. Increases in
shelter costs, while remaining relatively
high, have continued to ease, largely as ex-
pected, reflecting a deceleration in price in-
creases for new houses.
Financial Markets and Credit
Conditions
Since the April Report, longer-term interest
rates have increased in many economies
(Chart 3). The increase largely reflects ex-
pectations of higher real interest rates, con-
sistent with the outlook for continued
strong global economic growth. Expecta-
tions for policy rates have also generally
moved up.
In Canada, growth in household credit
remains robust, and growth in business
credit has moved above its historical aver-
age since the April Report. Monetary aggre-
gates have also grown robustly.
The Canadian dollar has appreciated
sharply, trading between 93 and 95.5 cents
U.S. since the May policy announcement

(Chart 4). The current value of the Canadian
dollar is well above the range of 86.5 to
89.5 cents U.S. assumed in the projection in
the April Report. Much of this appreciation
reflects the strength of demand for Canadi-
an goods and services and continuing firm
commodity prices. However, the currency
appears to have moved more strongly in re-
sponse to these factors than historical expe-
rience would suggest.
The Economic Outlook
The Bank’s base-case projection incorporates
the following key assumptions: a gradual
and orderly resolution of global imbalances,
energy prices evolving in line with current
futures prices, and a Canada/U.S. exchange
rate in the range of 93 to 95.5 cents U.S. ob-
served since the May policy announcement.
The outlook for the global economy is
slightly stronger than in the April Report,
with growth expected to remain robust over
the next three years. Some deceleration is
still expected, as global excess supply is re-
duced and as the impact of ongoing mone-
tary
policy
tightening
is
felt.
Global
economic growth is projected to ease from
5.0 per cent in 2007 to 4.8 per cent in 2008,
and to 4.6 per cent in 2009.
The projection for the U.S. economy is
little changed from that in the April Report.
GDP growth is expected to slow from about
3.3 per cent in 2006 to about 2.1 per cent in

2007. Lower residential investment is likely
to continue to reduce GDP growth over the
coming quarters. However, U.S. exports
should be supported by stronger growth in
domestic demand in other countries and by a
depreciating U.S. dollar, and business invest-
ment is picking up. GDP growth is projected
to be about 3 per cent in 2008 and 2009.
Futures prices for crude oil have in-
creased relative to those in the April Report.
The price index for non-energy commodities
is at a high level and is still expected to ease
gradually over the projection period.
In the Bank’s projection for Canada, GDP
growth is somewhat stronger in 2007 and
somewhat weaker in 2008 and 2009 than was
projected in the April Report. Quarterly
growth is expected to average about 2 3/4 per
cent at annual rates for the final three quar-
ters of this year and about 2 1/2 per cent
through 2008 and 2009 (Table 1).
Final domestic demand in Canada is ex-
pected to remain the key driver of economic
growth over the projection period, support-
ed by the strength of Canada’s terms of
trade
and
high
levels
of
employment
(Table 2). Growth in investment in machin-
ery and equipment should continue to boost
imports. Although the gradual strengthen-
ing of the U.S. economy over the projection
period is supportive of Canadian exports,
export growth is expected to be weaker than
previously projected owing to the higher
Canadian dollar. On balance, net ex-
ports are expected to subtract from growth
in 2008 and 2009.
Compared with the April Report, this
projection includes higher interest rates
across the yield curve and a higher exchange
rate, both of which act to moderate growth
and bring aggregate demand and supply in
Canada back into balance in 2009.2
2.
The assumption for potential output growth remains
unchanged from that used in the April Report, at 2.8 per cent in
both 2007 and 2008 and at 2.7 per cent in 2009.
The projection for core inflation for 2007
and 2008 is slightly higher than in the April
Report (Table 1). Greater excess demand
than was expected in April is projected to
keep core inflation above 2 per cent for a
longer period. But three factors should
bring core inflation back to 2 per cent by ear-
ly 2009. First, with economic activity moder-
ating somewhat in 2008 and 2009, excess
demand pressures are slowly worked off.
Second, with the stronger Canadian dollar,
downward pressure on inflation from lower
import prices is expected to be a little great-
er than earlier projected. And finally, the

contribution to inflation coming from price
increases for new houses is expected to con-
tinue to decline.
The projected path for the 12-month rate
of increase in the total CPI reflects the re-
vised outlook for the core rate, expectations
for energy prices, and the effect of past
changes in indirect taxes. With the higher
futures prices for oil and the direct effect of
the GST cut on inflation ending, total CPI in-
flation is projected to rise further in the sec-
ond half of this year. Considerable year-
over-year increases in gasoline prices, ow-
ing partly to the impact of the temporary
easing in gasoline prices in late 2006, will
cause total CPI inflation to peak in the fourth
quarter at about 3 per cent. CPI inflation is
then expected to decline, reaching the 2 per
cent target by early 2009.
