The Bank of Canada today announced that it is maintaining its target for the
overnight rate at 2 1/2 per cent. The operating band for the overnight rate is
unchanged, and the Bank Rate remains at 2 3/4 per cent.
Global and Canadian economic data received since the last interest rate
announcement on 12 April have been broadly in line with expectations. The
Bank's outlook for the Canadian economy through to the end of 2006 is
unchanged from that in the April Monetary Policy Report (MPR). Growth this year
and next is still expected to come primarily from domestic demand. Consistent
with the analysis in the MPR, the Canadian economy is expected to move back to
its production capacity in the second half of 2006, with core inflation projected to
return to 2 per cent around the end of next year. In line with this outlook, a
reduction of monetary stimulus will be required over time.
The outlook remains subject to both upside and downside risks. These risks relate
largely to global developments, the associated relative price changes, and the
adjustment of the Canadian economy.
