 ation-control strategy
Canada’s infl
 ation-control strategy
Infl
 ation targeting and the economy
 

The objective of Canada’s monetary policy is to promote the 
economic and fi
 nancial well-being of Canadians. Canada’s 
experience with infl
 ation targeting since 1991 has shown that the 
best way that monetary policy can achieve this goal is by maintaining 
a low and stable infl
 ation environment. Doing so fosters confi
 dence 
in the value of money and contributes to sustained economic growth, 
a strong and inclusive labour market and improved living standards.
 

In 2021, the Government of Canada and the Bank of Canada 
renewed the fl
 exible infl
 ation-targeting strategy of the monetary policy 
framework for a further fi
 ve-year period, ending December 31, 2026.1 
 

The infl
 ation target was renewed at the 2% midpoint of the 1%–3% 
control range, with infl
 ation measured as the 12-month rate of 
change in the consumer price index (CPI). 
 

The Government and the Bank agreed that the best contribution 
monetary policy can make to the economic and fi
 nancial 
well-being of Canadians is to continue to focus on price stability. 
The Government and the Bank also agreed that monetary policy 
should continue to support maximum sustainable employment, 
recognizing that maximum sustainable employment is not directly 
measurable and is determined largely by non-monetary factors 
that can change through time. 
 

Further, the Government and the Bank agreed that because well-
anchored infl
 ation expectations are critical to achieving both price 
stability and maximum sustainable employment, the primary objective 
of monetary policy is to maintain low, stable infl
 ation over time. 
Infl
 ation targeting is symmetric and ﬂ
 exible
 

Canada’s infl
 ation-targeting approach is symmetric, which means 
the Bank is equally concerned about infl
 ation rising above or falling 
below the 2% target. 
 

Canada’s infl
 ation-targeting approach is also ﬂ
 exible. Typically, 
the Bank seeks to return infl
 ation to target over a horizon of six to 
eight quarters. However, the most appropriate horizon for returning 
infl
 ation to target will vary depending on the nature and persistence 
of the shocks buffeting the economy.
 

The 2021 agreement with the Government specifi
 es that the 2% 
infl
 ation target remains the cornerstone of the framework. 
 

The agreement further notes that the Bank will continue to use the 
fl
 exibility of the 1%–3% control range to actively seek the maximum 
sustainable level of employment, when conditions warrant. The Bank 
will also continue to leverage the fl
 exibility inherent in the framework 
to help address the challenges of structurally low interest rates by 
using a broad set of policy tools. The Bank will use this fl
 exibility only 
to an extent that is consistent with keeping medium-term infl
 ation 
expectations well anchored at 2%.
Monetary policy tools
 

Because monetary policy actions take time to work their way through 
the economy and have their full effect on infl
 ation, monetary policy 
must be forward-looking.
 

The Bank normally carries out monetary policy through changes 
in the target for the overnight rate of interest (the policy rate). The 
Bank also has a range of monetary policy tools it can use when the 
policy rate is at very low levels. These tools consist of guidance on 
the future evolution of the policy rate, large-scale asset purchases 
(quantitative easing and credit easing), funding for credit measures, 
and negative policy rates. The potential use and sequencing of these 
tools would depend on the economic and fi
 nancial market context.
 

All of the Bank’s monetary policy tools affect total demand for 
Canadian goods and services through their infl
 uence on market 
interest rates, domestic asset prices and the exchange rate. The 
balance between this demand and the economy’s production 
capacity is, over time, the main factor that determines infl
 ation 
pressures in the economy.
Communications
 

Consistent with its commitment to clear, transparent communications, 
the Bank regularly reports its perspectives on the economy and 
infl
 ation. Policy decisions are typically announced on eight pre-set 
days during the year, and full updates to the Bank’s outlook are 
published four times each year in the Monetary Policy Report.
 

The Bank is committed to explaining when it is using the fl
 exibility of 
the infl
 ation-targeting strategy.
 

Given the uncertainty about the maximum sustainable level of 
employment, the Bank will consider a broad range of labour market 
indicators.2 The Bank will also systematically report to Canadians on 
how labour market outcomes have factored into its policy decisions.
Monitoring infl
 ation
 

In the short run, the prices of certain CPI components can be 
particularly volatile and can cause sizable fl
 uctuations in CPI infl
 ation.
 

In setting monetary policy, the Bank seeks to look through such 
transitory movements in CPI infl
 ation and focuses on “core” infl
 ation 
measures that better refl
 ect the underlying trend of infl
 ation. In this 
sense, these measures act as an operational guide to help the Bank 
achieve the CPI infl
 ation target. They are not a replacement for CPI 
infl
 ation.
 

The Bank’s two preferred measures of core infl
 ation are CPI-trim, 
which excludes CPI components whose rates of change in a given 
month are the most extreme, and CPI-median, which corresponds 
to the price change located at the 50th percentile (in terms of basket 
weight) of the distribution of price changes.

Overview
Overview
Global inflation is coming down, but core inflation in major economies is 
proving to be persistent. Central banks continue to see the need to maintain 
restrictive monetary policy to achieve their inflation targets.
This restrictive monetary policy and, to a much lesser extent, stress in the 
banking sector are anticipated to constrain global growth through 2023 and 
the first half of 2024. Growth is then projected to pick up in 2025 as the 
effects of policy tightening fade. 
In Canada, consumer price index (CPI) inflation is expected to come down 
quickly to around 3% in the middle of 2023 and then decline more gradually, 
reaching the 2% target by the end of 2024. 
Goods price inflation is easing quickly, reflecting lower energy prices, improved 
global supply chains and the effects of restrictive monetary policy on sectors 
sensitive to interest rates. Inflation is then forecast to return the rest of the way 
to the 2% target more gradually because services price inflation is responding 
more slowly to the effects of restrictive monetary policy.
Demand in Canada still exceeds supply, and the labour market remains tight. 
Although the slowing economy and increasing labour supply are helping 
relieve some of this tightness, the labour market is still above maximum 
sustainable employment. 
Economic growth is expected to be subdued through the remainder of this 
year, with the economy moving into excess supply in the second half, and 
then to pick up gradually through 2024. 
Strong population growth is supporting aggregate consumption and 
employment growth. Household spending is being restrained by higher 
interest rates. At current interest rates, the share of income spent on interest 
payments will continue to rise as homeowners renew their mortgages. 
Growth in business investment and exports is also expected to soften, 
reflecting increased borrowing costs and weaker foreign demand.
With slow growth in Canada for the next several quarters, the Bank of 
Canada anticipates near-term inflation expectations to decline, services 
price inflation and wage growth to moderate, and the pricing behaviour of 
businesses to normalize. As these things happen, domestic price pressures 
will ease further, returning inflation gradually to the 2% target. 
On an annual average basis, growth in gross domestic product (GDP) in 
Canada is projected to be 1.4% this year and 1.3% in 2024. As the economy 
adjusts to higher interest rates and inflation returns to the 2% target, 
GDP growth is projected to pick back up in 2025, reaching 2.5%.

Inflation has fallen from its 2022 peak in most regions. However, core 
measures of inflation and, in particular, services price inflation remain high 
in many countries. Major central banks continue to communicate the need to 
maintain restrictive monetary policy to achieve their inflation targets.
Volatility in financial markets increased sharply after the recent banking 
sector stress in the United States and Europe. Authorities reacted swiftly to 
limit the effects of this stress on the global financial system. Even so, credit 
conditions have tightened modestly, and the potential for further stress has 
increased uncertainty.  
Global growth is expected to weaken through the second half of 2023 
to the first half of 2024, weighed down by restrictive monetary policy in 
advanced economies. To a lesser extent, headwinds coming from tighter 
credit conditions are also anticipated to restrain growth in the United States 
and Europe. In contrast, the lifting of most COVID‑19 restrictions in China 
is leading to a rebound in activity in 2023 that supports global growth 
and demand for commodities. Overall, global growth averages about 
2.4% over 2023 and 2024. Growth is then projected to pick up to 2.8% in 
2025 (Table 1).

BANK OF CANADA  •  Monetary Policy Report  •  April 2023
Global growth in 2023 has been revised up since the January Report due to 
stronger economic activity in nearly all regions, despite restrictive monetary 
policy and the negative impact of tighter credit conditions in the United States 
and Europe. Growth in 2024 is revised down due to further tightening of 
monetary policy in advanced economies as well as banking sector stress 
since the January Report (Box 1).   
The Bank expects inflation in most advanced economies to decline meaningfully 
over 2023, mostly due to easing inflation in goods prices. In contrast, services 
price inflation is projected to stay elevated for longer. Over time, monetary policy 
tightening is anticipated to reduce demand for services, soften employment and 
better align growth in labour costs with productivity. By the end of the projection 
horizon, inflation is forecast to be near central bank targets. 
Box 1
Changes to the economic projection since the January Report
Global outlook
The following factors explain changes to the outlook in 
regions important for the Canadian economy:
 
 In the United States, the outlook for growth has 
been revised up in 2023 but down in 2024. Recent 
economic data have been stronger than anticipated. 
Robust goods consumption, including motor vehicle 
sales, and a broad-based pickup in exports support 
stronger near-term growth. Stress in the US regional 
banking sector weighs on growth in 2023 and 2024. 
In addition, the Bank of Canada assumes that 
US monetary policy will tighten further because 
infl
 ationary pressures are stronger than projected in 
the January Report.
 
 Growth in the euro area has been revised up in 
2023 largely because of an improved outlook for 
its energy supply. Growth has been revised down 
for 2024 due to greater-than-expected infl
 ationary 
pressures, pointing to more tightening of monetary 
policy than previously assumed. Recent banking 
stress also weighs on growth in 2023 and 2024.
Overall, global growth has been revised up by 
0.7 percentage points in 2023 but has been revised 
down slightly in 2024. Growth in foreign demand for 
Canadian exports, however, has been revised down 
over the projection horizon, refl
 ecting weaker growth in 
sectors important for Canadian exports.
Canadian outlook
 
 The level of potential output over the projection 
horizon has been revised down by about 0.3% 
since the January Report, largely because of 
weaker business investment. Details on the Bank’s 
assessment of potential output growth are provided 
in the Appendix (page 25).
 
 Job gains have been stronger than expected. This 
refl
 ects both unexpected strength in labour demand 
and increases in labour supply. The latter is due to 
robust population growth and increases in the labour 
force participation rate. 
 
 Growth in gross domestic product (GDP) in the 
fourth quarter of 2022 came in fl
 at and below 
expectations. The weaker outcome was due mostly 
to a normalization in inventory investment that had 
been expected to occur over the fi
 rst half of 2023.
 
 GDP growth has been revised up in 2023 and down 
in 2024. Table 2 and Table 3 provide the revisions 
to the forecast.
 

Growth in consumption spending is temporarily 
boosted in 2023 by stronger-than-expected 
employment and population growth and by 
the new temporary transfers announced in 
government budgets.
 

New fi
 scal measures announced in recent 
federal and provincial budgets—adding about 
$25 billion per year over the next three years—
also support GDP.
 

Export growth surged unexpectedly in the 
fi
 rst quarter of 2023, led by the supply chain 
improvements in the auto sector and the 
shipping of the abundant 2022 agricultural 
harvest. This strength is temporary, and export 
growth has been revised down thereafter due 
to negative revisions to demand for Canadian 
exports from the United States.
 

Inventory investment is expected to be less of a 
drag on growth throughout 2023.
 
 The outlook for consumer price index infl
 ation is 
broadly unchanged over 2023 and 2024.

BANK OF CANADA  •  Monetary Policy Report  •  April 2023
Persistent inflation 
Goods price inflation is declining in most advanced economies (Chart 1). 
This reflects improvements in supply chains and lower energy prices.1 
Demand for goods is also slowing due to past increases in interest rates 
and a shift in spending patterns back toward high-contact services. These 
dynamics are expected to continue, with falling goods price inflation 
accounting for most of the anticipated decline in inflation across advanced 
economies in 2023.
Services price inflation, however, continues to be elevated and is projected to 
decline more slowly. Demand for services is strong, and labour markets in the 
United States and the euro area remain tight. Results from a survey by the 
Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond indicate that firms in the United States 
expect services price inflation to be around 4% over the near term. 
By the end of this year, inflation is projected to remain well above central 
bank targets. Further declines in inflation will largely depend on how quickly 
growth in services prices slows.
Tighter credit conditions 
Credit conditions have tightened in some regions since the January Report 
(Chart 2). In early March, deposit runs at Silicon Valley Bank and Signature 
Bank led the US Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to take control of 
both banks and offer extraordinary support to their depositors. Soon after, 
Credit Suisse came under severe market stress, and the Swiss authorities 
responded by facilitating a takeover by UBS. 
1	 For example, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s Global Supply Chain Pressure Index is now below 
its historical average after having been significantly elevated for the past two years.

BANK OF CANADA  •  Monetary Policy Report  •  April 2023
In the past, prolonged episodes of stress in the banking sector have typically 
led to decreased credit issuance in the primary market and wider credit 
spreads for financial institutions. This made bank funding more expensive, 
which caused banks to tighten lending conditions. 
Recently, funding costs for US banks have increased, and concerns exist that 
conditions could deteriorate further. Consequently, some pullback in lending 
is expected, particularly at US regional banks, which play an important role in 
lending to small businesses.
Credit risk spreads also widened sharply in mid-March. This tightening was 
partially offset by a fall in long-term government bond yields. More recently, 
financial markets have largely stabilized, and many indicators of financial 
conditions have improved. 
The Can$/US$ exchange rate is broadly unchanged since the January 
Report (Chart 3 and Box 2).

Key inputs to the projection
The Bank of Canada’s projection is conditional on 
several key inputs and assumptions about their future 
path. The Bank regularly reviews these assumptions 
and adjusts the economic projection accordingly. The 
key inputs to the Bank’s projection are as follows:
 
 Oil prices have been volatile recently, refl
 ecting 
heightened stress in the global fi
 nancial system 
and production cuts announced by some large oil 
producers. Over the projection horizon, the per-barrel 
prices for oil in US dollars are assumed to be $85 
for Brent and $80 for West Texas Intermediate, both 
unchanged from the January Report. The per-barrel 
price of Western Canadian Select is assumed to be 
$65, which is $5 higher than in the January Report. 
 
 Prices for non-energy commodities are expected to 
remain around current levels over the projection horizon.
 
 By convention, the Bank does not forecast the 
exchange rate in the Monetary Policy Report. The 
Canadian dollar is assumed to remain at 74 cents 
US over the projection horizon, close to its recent 
average and unchanged from the assumption in the 
January Report.
 
 Potential output growth in Canada is expected to 
increase from 1.4% in 2022 to about 2% over the 
projection horizon. Details about the Bank’s outlook 
for potential output growth are provided in the 
Appendix (page 25).
 
 Real gross domestic product (GDP) is estimated 
to have grown at about the same pace as potential 
output in the fi
 rst quarter of 2023. As a result, the 
Bank estimates that the output gap is between 
0.25% and 1.25% in the fi
 rst quarter, unchanged 
from the estimate for the fourth quarter of 2022.1 
 
 The projection incorporates information from all 
provincial and federal budgets available at the time 
of writing. 
 
 The nominal neutral interest rate in Canada is 
estimated to be in the range of 2% to 3%.2 The 
economic projection assumes that the neutral rate is 
at the midpoint of this range. Details about the Bank’s 
annual assessment are provided in the Appendix.
1 The output gap for the fourth quarter of 2022, estimated to be between 
0.50% and 1.50% in the January Report, has been revised down and is now 
estimated to be between 0.25% and 1.25%. This is due mainly to weaker-
than-expected GDP in that quarter (Box 1 and Table 3).
2 The nominal neutral policy interest rate is defi
 ned as the real neutral rate 
plus 2% for infl
 ation. The real neutral rate is the rate consistent with both 
output remaining sustainably at its potential and infl
 ation remaining at target, 
on an ongoing basis. It is a medium- to long-term equilibrium concept. For 
more details, see J. Champagne, C. Hajzler, D. Matveev, H. Melinchuk, 
A. Poulin-Moore, K. Ozhan, Y. Park and T. Taskin, “Potential output and 
neutral rate in Canada: 2023 assessment,” Bank of Canada Staff Analytical 
Note (forthcoming); and S. Ahmed, A. Avshalumov, T. Chaar, E. Ekanayake,

BANK OF CANADA  •  Monetary Policy Report  •  April 2023
Slow US growth and demand for Canadian exports 
Economic growth in the United States has been stronger than expected in 
the January Report. However, US growth is projected to slow sharply in the 
second quarter of 2023 and to stall through the first quarter of 2024. Weak 
growth over this period is largely due to the tightening in both monetary policy 
and, to a lesser extent, credit conditions. 
Over the projection horizon, components of US activity important for 
Canadian exports are anticipated to grow more slowly than US GDP for the 
following reasons:
	
 US consumers are expected to moderate their spending on goods to 
a greater extent than on services. This reflects two factors. First, after 
surging early in the pandemic, the share of household income spent on 
goods is projected to decline. Second, increases in interest rates will 
have a larger effect on the consumption of goods than of services. These 
developments disproportionately affect US demand for Canadian products 
because non-commodity exports from Canada are geared more toward 
goods than services. 
	
 US firms are anticipated to significantly reduce investment spending on 
equipment—a key determinant of Canadian exports. 
Soft activity in the euro area
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine continues to greatly affect the euro area 
economy. Disruptions to energy supplies have dampened production in the 
manufacturing sector. Elevated inflation is eroding purchasing power and 
weighing on household demand.
Warmer-than-normal weather this winter and new supplies of non-Russian 
natural gas improved the outlook for the supply of energy in Europe, and this 
has boosted consumer and business confidence. Unemployment is also low 
across the euro area. 
Nevertheless, rising interest rates are expected to reduce demand and 
ease inflation toward the European Central Bank’s target over the projection 
horizon. Economic growth is forecast to remain below potential until the 
second half of 2024 and then pick up.
Strong growth in China
Growth in economic activity in China is anticipated to be robust in the first 
half of 2023. Domestic demand has been strengthening since the lifting of 
most COVID‑19 restrictions, with services such as air travel showing signs 
of a strong recovery. While residential investment has picked up recently, 
past overbuilding and past regulatory tightening are still expected to 
constrain activity in the property sector. Fiscal and monetary policy remain 
accommodative. 
The pace of economic growth is projected to slow in the second half of 2023 
as the effects of reopening the economy dissipate. An ongoing decline in the 
working-age population weighs on economic activity in 2024 and 2025.

BANK OF CANADA  •  Monetary Policy Report  •  April 2023
Volatile oil prices  
After recent volatility, global oil prices have returned to the levels observed 
at the time of the January Report (Chart 4). Stress in the banking sector 
caused a sharp fall in oil prices in early March. Later improvements in 
financial conditions partly offset this decline. Prices have rebounded further 
after several members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting 
Countries (OPEC) and some non-OPEC oil producers announced plans to 
cut production. 
Consequently, the Bank’s assumption for global oil prices is the same 
as in the January Report. The price for Brent oil is assumed to be 
US$85 per barrel, while the price for West Texas Intermediate (WTI) is 
assumed to be US$80. 
Since the January Report, the discount on Western Canadian Select (WCS) 
over WTI has declined to around US$15 per barrel. WCS prices have risen 
because seasonal maintenance has slowed production in Canada. At the 
same time, US refinery outages have eased, and releases of oil from the 
US Strategic Petroleum Reserve have largely concluded.
Prices for natural gas have dropped further in both North America and 
Europe in response to the mild winter. Concerns about shortages of natural 
gas in Europe have eased, and Europe is now expected to enter next winter 
with an adequate level of reserves. 
The Bank’s non-energy commodity price index is modestly lower than in the 
January Report. Prices for base metals have fallen because demand from 
the Chinese construction sector did not strengthen as much as markets had 
anticipated. Lumber prices have also declined, reflecting a further weakening 
in US housing activity. Agricultural prices remain largely unchanged.

CPI inflation in Canada remains too high but continues to decline from recent 
peaks because of falling energy prices and smaller price increases for other 
goods. As expected at the time of the January Report, inflation declined in 
February, reaching 5.2%.
Ongoing excess demand in the economy and a still-tight labour market 
continue to exert upward pressure on domestic prices.
Economic growth is anticipated to slow from 3.4% in 2022 to 1.4% in 2023 
and 1.3% in 2024 (Table 2). After a bounceback in the first quarter of 2023, 
quarterly growth is expected to be weak through the rest of the year. It then 
picks up gradually through 2024. Restrictive monetary policy continues to 
weigh on household spending and business investment, and weak foreign 
demand restrains export growth.
At the same time, strong population growth is boosting aggregate 
consumption spending as well as adding to labour supply. Economic growth 
picks up in 2025, reaching 2.5% as foreign demand strengthens and the 
effects of past monetary policy tightening fade.

BANK OF CANADA  •  Monetary Policy Report  •  April 2023
The Bank still expects CPI inflation to come down to around 3% in the middle 
of 2023. Goods price inflation is falling due to past declines in gasoline 
prices, improvements in global supply chains and moderating effects of high 
interest rates on global demand. In contrast, shelter price inflation is still high. 
Inflation in the prices of many other services also remains elevated. This   
reflects the strength in the demand for services as households catch up on 
what they missed during the pandemic as well as ongoing tightness in the 
labour market.  
CPI inflation returns to the 2% target at the end of 2024. As high interest rates 
slow demand and supply grows, the economy moves into modest excess 
supply in the second half of 2023. Pressures in domestic product and labour 
markets begin to ease. Price and wage growth moderates, while productivity 
growth picks up. Services price inflation gradually eases as it responds more 
slowly to the effects of restrictive monetary policy.
High but declining inflation
CPI inflation is declining largely as expected, reaching 5.2% in February 
(Chart 5, panel a). The most important contribution to the decline has 
been the fall in energy prices.2 Inflation for prices of goods excluding food 
and energy has also come down modestly. In contrast, inflation for food 
purchased from stores remains elevated, staying just above 10%. Historical 
experience suggests that the recent easing of cost pressures in production 
and distribution will lead to declines in food price inflation over the coming 
months (Chart 6). 
Three-month CPI inflation has fallen to about 1.6% (Chart 5, panel b). This 
suggests that headline inflation will continue to drop in the near term.
Core inflation has eased slightly, to just below 5%. With measures of three-
month core inflation around 3.5%, core inflation is expected to decline in the 
coming months. 
2	 For a description of the global and domestic forces that drove inflation to 40-year highs, see C. 
Rogers, “Understanding the reasons for high inflation” (speech delivered to the Manitoba Chambers of 
Commerce, Winnipeg, Manitoba, March 9, 2023).

Nonetheless, core inflation remains well above CPI inflation on a three-month 
basis. Much of the additional strength comes from inflation in core services 
excluding shelter, which has been more persistent in recent months than 
inflation in overall services excluding shelter (Chart 7).3 For CPI inflation to 
return sustainably to the 2% target, core inflation will need to come down 
further. 
3	 Core services excluding shelter isolates the components of non-shelter services that contribute to CPI-
trim each month. A large portion of the difference between core services excluding shelter and services 
excluding shelter can be explained by the exclusion of falling prices in child care services.

Elevated but declining inflation expectations
Inflation expectations of firms, consumers and professional forecasters have 
edged down according to recent surveys (Chart 8). Moreover, results from 
the Business Outlook Survey (BOS) for the first quarter of 2023 indicate that 
views about inflation have continued to decline. Fewer respondents expect 
inflation over the next two years to be in the 5% to 6% range and more 
expect it to be in the 2% to 3% range when compared with the previous 
surveys (Chart 9). 
Nevertheless, most respondents to business and consumer surveys still 
think that CPI inflation will be higher than the Bank’s inflation forecast over 
the next two years. For instance, expectations of BOS respondents remain 
centred around the 3% to 4% range. Long-term inflation expectations remain 
consistent with the 2% target.

Economy still in excess demand
The pace of economic activity in Canada has slowed since mid-2022, but 
demand still exceeds supply. Overall, the estimate of the output gap—the 
difference between GDP and potential output—is between 0.25% and 1.25% 
in the first quarter of 2023. 
The labour market remains tight, and a broad range of indicators suggest that 
it is still above maximum sustainable employment (Chart 10). Employment 
gains reported in Statistics Canada’s Labour Force Survey have been 
stronger than expected, with more than 205,000 net new jobs created in the 
first three months of 2023.
The steady increase in labour input indicates that strong labour demand 
has continued, but labour supply has also greatly expanded. As noted in the 
January Report, increases in child care subsidies and more flexible work 
arrangements have contributed to rising labour force participation rates 
among women. Moreover, strong inflows of permanent and non-permanent 
residents have led to a large increase in the labour force (Chart 11). 
In particular, businesses have considerably broadened their use of the 
Temporary Foreign Worker Program.
Tightening monetary policy is moderating the demand for labour in 
industries where demand is the most sensitive to interest rates (Chart 12). 
Respondents to the BOS note that it has become easier to find the workers 
they need. Firms attribute this to less competition for labour and improved 
labour supply.

Most wage growth measures remain around the 4% to 5% range, with 
increases broadly based across sectors (Chart 13). In recent business 
surveys, firms expect the pace of wage growth to slow over the coming year, 
although the size of their planned wage increases is still above the historical 
average. Unless a surprisingly strong pickup in productivity growth occurs, 
sustained 4% to 5% wage growth is not consistent with achieving the 2% 
inflation target.
Businesses continue to report capacity constraints, including some labour 
shortages and supply chain challenges, which weigh on production and 
sales. Nevertheless, firms are reporting an easing in capacity pressures from 
exceptionally high levels last year.

BANK OF CANADA  •  Monetary Policy Report  •  April 2023
Modest demand growth amid rising supply 
After a weaker-than-expected fourth quarter in 2022, real GDP is estimated 
to have picked up to 2.3% in the first quarter of 2023. For the rest of the 
year, growth is forecast to be weak, averaging less than 1% (Chart 14 and 
Table 3).
Increases in interest rates in Canada are weighing on growth in domestic 
demand. At the same time, high interest rates—and, to a lesser degree, 
US regional bank stress—are limiting demand for Canadian exports.

In contrast, strong population growth supports household spending. 
Increases in population from immigration and temporary residents are a 
source of both supply and demand. This means that the economy may be 
able to grow at a somewhat faster pace than previously expected without 
generating additional inflationary pressures. 
Overall, with demand growth falling below potential output growth, the 
economy moves into modest excess supply in the second half of 2023.
In 2024, GDP growth is projected to pick up gradually, reaching 2.5% in 
2025 as foreign demand strengthens and the effects of high interest rates on 
growth fade (Table 2). 
Potential output growth is assumed to average about 2% over the projection 
horizon, reflecting solid growth in trend labour input and a rebound in trend 
labour productivity (Appendix, page 25). The labour force expands robustly 
due to strong immigration and an influx of temporary residents. This more 
than offsets the drag from an aging population.
Fiscal measures adding to the growth of domestic 
demand
Growth in overall government spending was robust in the second half of 
2022, averaging 3.5% when adjusted for inflation. Recent provincial and 
federal budgets suggest that government spending will moderate to around 
2.5% in the first half of 2023 and then slow to near the pace of potential 
growth. Over the projection horizon, government spending will contribute 
steadily to GDP growth, with the biggest contribution coming from provincial 
spending.  
Government transfers are also expected to remain elevated in the near term, 
supporting household spending. In particular, the $2.5 billion temporary 
extension to the goods and services tax credit provides targeted support 
to low-income households to offset the impact of high inflation on their 
budgets. In addition, tax cuts in some provinces will boost disposable income 
throughout the projection horizon. For instance, provincial tax reductions in 
Quebec for the two lowest income brackets will provide about $1.7 billion 
annually to Quebec households starting in 2023.
Roughly $25 billion per year in additional fiscal measures is added to the 
projection compared with the January Report. 
Slow growth in household spending
Consumer spending is anticipated to be subdued beginning in the second 
half of 2023 and into 2024 as the effects of the tightening in monetary policy 
work their way through the economy. Household spending is affected through 
several channels.  
The first channel is the impact on debt-servicing costs. This is a key channel 
given the high level of household debt. The effective interest rate on 
household debt is estimated to have risen to 5.5% in the first quarter of 2023. 
Interest payments rose to $133 billion on an annual basis in the fourth quarter 
of 2022, 45% higher than one year earlier. The share of income spent on 
interest payments will continue to rise as homeowners renew their mortgages 
(Box 3).

BANK OF CANADA  •  Monetary Policy Report  •  April 2023
Box 3
Impact of higher mortgage rates on household budgets
One way monetary policy affects infl
 ation is through its 
impact on household borrowing.
When interest rates rise, higher debt-servicing costs 
leave many households with less money for other 
spending. This slows overall demand growth—which, 
in turn, relieves price pressures and helps bring down 
infl
 ation.
Household debt comes in many forms, including 
mortgages, home equity lines of credit, unsecured lines 
of credit and loans for motor vehicles. In 2022, mortgages 
made up more than half of households’ total debt-service 
payments.
When interest rates rise or fall, interest payments on 
variable-rate mortgages respond quickly.1 In contrast, 
interest payments on fi
 xed-rate mortgages respond 
much more slowly because they adjust to prevailing rates 
only when households take out a new mortgage or renew 
an existing one.
Changes in borrowing behaviour
To mitigate an increase in their interest costs, borrowers 
may take several courses of action. Those with enough 
resources could pay off some of their outstanding 
mortgage balance or make payments on their principal 
more quickly. Financially constrained households, 
however, may scale back on voluntary repayments 
of principal or extend the amortization period of their 
mortgage when they renew.
Borrowers can also shift their mortgage term preference. 
Recently, as short-term interest rates have increased, 
new borrowers have shifted away from variable- and fi
 ve-
year fi
 xed-rate mortgages toward fi
 xed-rate mortgages 
1 Although their interest costs can vary over time, most variable-rate 
mortgages feature fi
 xed payments for the term of the loan. When interest 
rates increase, a larger share of the borrower’s payment is typically assigned 
automatically to interest costs rather than principal repayment, leaving the 
total amount paid unchanged. This is similar to extending the amount of time 
needed to repay the mortgage and leaves the borrower with a higher overall 
borrowing cost.
with terms between one and four years (Chart 3-A). 
This suggests that many borrowers are assuming that 
mortgage rates will be lower in a few years. 
Substantial increases in borrowing costs
Since the fi
 rst quarter of 2022, the effective interest 
rates on variable-rate mortgages have increased 
by about 4½ percentage points, and those on fi
 xed-
rate mortgages by about ½ a percentage point.2 By 
the beginning of 2023, the effective interest rate on 
all outstanding mortgages had increased by about 
1¾ percentage points.
2 The effective interest rate is the average rate of interest paid on all 
outstanding loans. The rate adjusts particularly slowly for long-term loans 
with fi
 xed rates of interest because most outstanding loans are not renewed 
or originated in a given period. Moreover, borrowers’ choices about which 
loans to pursue infl
 uence the dynamics of effective interest rates.

The second channel is that elevated interest rates are raising the cost of 
financing purchases of big-ticket items. Most respondents to the Canadian 
Survey of Consumer Expectations (CSCE) for the first quarter of 2023 
indicated that, in response, they expect to postpone major purchases and cut 
back spending more generally. As the effects of high interest rates continue 
to work their way through the economy, spending on services will also be 
affected. For instance, some CSCE respondents expect to reduce their 
discretionary spending—such as on travel and restaurant meals—over the 
next 12 months compared with the previous 12 months.
Lastly, low consumer confidence and reduced wealth are also expected to 
restrain household spending this year. 
In contrast, government transfers will continue to support household 
spending. Strong population growth, though slower than in recent quarters, 
will provide a significant boost to aggregate consumption spending 
throughout the projection.
Growth in consumption is expected to pick up gradually over 2024 as the 
drag from monetary policy wanes and wealth recovers. The savings rate is 
anticipated to remain above its pre-pandemic average because of elevated 
interest rates and precautionary savings.
Box 3 (continued)
For illustrative purposes only, Bank staff constructed 
a scenario to demonstrate the potential impact on 
households’ debt-service costs. In the scenario, the 
policy interest rate is assumed to follow the expected 
path for the overnight interest rate derived from fi
 nancial 
markets on April 4.3 As a result, the effective interest 
rate on variable-rate mortgages peaks in the fi
 rst half 
2023. Meanwhile, the effective interest rate on fi
 xed-rate 
mortgages rises through 2024 as mortgages with low 
interest rates reach the end of their term and are replaced 
by new (or renewed) mortgages with higher rates. 
The rising interest rates will impact mortgage holders. In 
order to get a sense of how important rising mortgage 
interest rates are for the Canadian economy, it is useful 
to compare mortgage interest payments to aggregate 
disposable income. In the scenario, the interest 
portion of household mortgage payments plateaus at 
about 5.5% of disposable income in the third quarter 
of 2023 (Chart 3-B). This would be the highest level 
observed since the late 1990s. The portion of aggregate 
household income available for discretionary spending 
is about 2 percentage points lower than at the time of 
the fi
 rst rate hike in early 2022. Borrowers may be able 
to mitigate some of these increased costs; however, 
their budgets will continue to feel the strain of these 
costs over the coming quarters.
3 At the end of market trading on April 4, 2023, fi
 nancial markets were pricing in 
a decline of about 60 basis points in the overnight rate by the end of the year 
and a further 100-basis-point decline by the end of 2024.

Housing activity has been weak (Chart 15). The Bank expects that it will 
stabilize around the middle of the year. Growth in residential investment 
is anticipated to resume in the second half of 2023. Strong demand from 
immigration should support housing activity over the projection horizon.
Moderate export growth
After surging early in 2023, exports are expected to stall over the rest of the 
year, reflecting the weakness in foreign demand (Chart 16). Export growth 
is anticipated to pick up over 2024. The outlook for exports reflects differing 
trajectories for non-commodity and commodity exports.
Non-commodity exports are projected to decline through 2024. This reflects 
waning foreign demand and fewer exports of motor vehicles as manufacturing 
facilities retool their plants to produce electric vehicles. The ongoing recovery in 
international travel and other services exports partially offsets these factors. Non-
commodity exports are forecast to pick up over 2025.
In contrast, commodity exports are expected to be strong over the projection. 
Growth in energy exports should stay robust in the near term due to elevated 
oil prices. The completion of the Trans Mountain Expansion project in 2024 
also supports this growth. For non-energy commodity exports, growth is 
boosted in the near term due to improved global supply chains. However, it 
slows later in the projection because of anticipated weak foreign demand.
Import growth and domestic demand growth are both forecast to slow by the 
middle of 2024, but import growth picks up later as the economy strengthens.

Soft business investment
Business investment is expected to stall through mid-2024, dampened by 
slow demand growth and rising financing costs (Chart 17). Growth is also 
moderated by the completion of large infrastructure projects for energy 
transportation in mid-2023. Business investment is projected to strengthen 
over 2024 and 2025.
Slowing demand and high financing costs dampen the outlook for business 
investment outside the oil and gas sector. According to results from business 
surveys, many firms have already reduced, or plan to reduce, their capital 
expenditures. They often mention elevated borrowing costs and tight credit 
conditions—as well as the negative implications of these for economic 
activity—as key reasons for this decision. 
Business investment outside the oil and gas sector is anticipated to pick up 
in 2024, led by the diminishing impact of high interest rates and improving 
demand conditions. Strengthening business investment supports potential 
output over the projection horizon through its effect on capital accumulation.
In the oil and gas sector, investment growth is projected to slow significantly 
as the transition to a low-carbon economy weakens prospects for oil demand 
over the long term. Uncertainty about the expansion of energy transportation 
capacity beyond ongoing projects also weighs on firms’ investment intentions 
in that sector.
After a period of volatility, inventory investment is expected to stabilize 
somewhat and contribute little to growth over the projection horizon. However, 
the ratio of inventory to sales remains elevated because firms are keeping 
higher inventory levels in part to manage supply chain risk.

CPI inflation at 3% in mid-2023 and at target at the end 
of 2024
CPI inflation is forecast to decline quickly to about 3% in the middle of 
2023, largely due to falling gasoline prices and weakening inflation in goods 
excluding food and energy (Chart 18). The latter results from slow growth 
in global demand, improvements in the performance of supply chains and a 
decline in the costs of some materials. At the same time, inflation in shelter 
prices is expected to remain high. Inflation in the prices of many other 
services is also projected to stay elevated, partly reflecting the delayed 
pickup in demand for these services compared with demand for goods. 
Respondents to the BOS continue to report they expect pressures on their 
input and output prices will be less intense in the future than they were in 
the previous 12 months. They anticipate a slower pace of price growth due 
to lower commodity prices, improved supply chains and softer demand 
conditions. Businesses also expect the size and pace of price changes to 
decline, which suggests that their price-setting behaviour is starting to shift 
closer to their pre-pandemic practices.4 
Inflation is subsequently projected to decline slowly from 3% to reach 2% at 
the end of 2024 (Chart 19). This more gradual decline in CPI inflation reflects 
the slower response in services prices to tighter monetary conditions. The 
Canadian economy is projected to move into modest excess supply only 
in the second half of 2023. As pressures in domestic product and labour 
markets ease, wage and price growth moderate while productivity growth 
picks up. Short-term inflation expectations are also projected to decline 
steadily. As a result, inflation in services prices slows gradually.
The inflation outlook is subject to considerable uncertainty (see Risks to the 
inflation outlook).

Risks to the inflation outlook
Risks to the inflation outlook
Risks to the inflation outlook have evolved since the January Report, but 
many of the risks identified in past reports remain important. Although the 
Bank views these risks as roughly balanced, the upside risks are of greater 
concern because inflation is still too high.
Main upside risk: Persistent services price inflation 
Canadian services price inflation remains high, and its persistence is the 
main upside risk over the projection. Unit labour cost growth in the services 
sector may be higher and more persistent than projected, which could occur 
if the labour market remains tight or if productivity growth remains weak. 
Elevated services price inflation could also last longer if elevated near-term 
inflation expectations prove to be more persistent than projected.  
Some additional risks identified in the January Report are also still relevant. If 
the recovery in China is stronger than expected or new developments restrict 
the global supply of oil, energy prices could increase sharply, pushing CPI 
inflation up. In addition, while global supply chain pressures have eased, 
geopolitical tensions still pose an upside risk to inflation because of their 
potential to trigger new spikes in the prices of internationally traded goods. 
Main downside risk: Severe global slowdown
As noted in previous reports, a severe global slowdown is the key downside 
risk to inflation. Financial and banking sector vulnerabilities—including high 
levels of household and corporate debt and balance sheet mismatches in 
the banking sector—could amplify the impacts of slowing global growth as 
monetary policy tightens in advanced economies.
The limited tightening in financial conditions due to the recent banking sector 
stress has been embedded into the base case. However, if global banking 
stresses intensify further, global credit conditions could tighten significantly. 
If this risk materializes, a more severe global slowdown and sharply lower 
commodity prices could follow. The Canadian economy would be affected 
through tighter financial and credit conditions, weaker foreign demand, lower 
terms of trade, and declines in business and consumer confidence. Rising 
unemployment could also interact with high household debt and housing 
vulnerabilities, amplifying the economic downturn in Canada.

Potential output growth in Canada is expected to rebound to about 2% in 
2023 and remain there throughout the projection horizon (Table A-1). The 
Bank’s estimate of potential output growth in Canada has been revised down 
compared with the estimate in the April 2022 Report.5
The estimated range for the Canadian nominal neutral rate of interest is 2% 
to 3%—unchanged since the April 2022 Report.6
5	 These revisions include the effects of developments throughout 2022, many of which were already 
incorporated in the October 2022 and January 2023 projections. For example, the impact of supply 
chain disruptions on potential output was revised in the October Report, and these estimates are largely 
unchanged since January.

Strengthening potential output growth 
In Canada, growth of potential output is expected to increase from 1.4% in 
2022 to 2.3% in 2023 and to stabilize around 2% on average over 2023–26 
(Chart A-1). The weakness in potential output growth in 2022 results from 
global supply chain disruptions.
Over the projection horizon, growth of trend labour input contributes 
1.3 percentage points per year to potential output growth. Its strength comes 
from an increasing contribution of immigration to growth in the working-age 
population. Additional strength in the near term comes from a surge in non-
permanent residents. A decline in trend hours worked per person provides a 
partial offset to trend labour input. This decline results in part from the impact 
of population aging on labour force participation rates. Growth of trend labour 
productivity adds an additional 0.9 percentage points to potential output 
growth per year over the projection horizon.
Compared with the April 2022 estimate, potential output growth is revised 
down by 1 percentage point in 2023 and by 0.3 percentage points on 
average in 2024 and 2025 (Table A-2). The negative revisions reflect weaker 
business investment and a greater-than-expected impact from global supply 
disruptions. In particular, firms are reconfiguring their supply chains to make 
them more resilient. An upward revision to projected immigration partially 
offsets these downward revisions. 
Considerable uncertainty surrounds the estimate of potential output. Most 
of the components of potential output cannot be directly observed and, as 
a result, are challenging to forecast. This uncertainty is reflected in a range 
constructed around midpoint estimates. The outlook for potential output is 
subject to both upside and downside risks. Uncertainty about the outlook for 
immigration, the persistence of supply chain issues and emerging threats 
to global trade integration are elevated, which could affect potential output 
growth.

Modest pickup in global potential output growth
Projected growth of global potential output is expected to rise from 2.5% in 
2022 to 2.8% in 2026 (Table A-1). Russia’s invasion of Ukraine reduced the 
growth of global potential output in 2022, particularly through its effects on 
the euro area and the countries of Central and Eastern Europe. Potential 
output growth in these regions is expected to gradually return to pre-invasion 
rates over the projection horizon. Slowing potential output growth in China 
partially offsets the impact on growth dynamics for global potential output, as 
growth in labour productivity slows and the working-age population declines. 
In the United States, potential output growth remains stable at around 1.8%. 
Overall, the Bank is projecting a lower level of global potential output growth 
than estimated in the April 2022 Report. Growth is 0.4 percentage points 
weaker in 2022 and 0.2 percentage points weaker in 2023. The downward 
revisions are because of larger-than-expected effects of the war on the euro 
area and nearby economies and weaker productivity growth in China.
Unchanged neutral rate of interest 
The Bank estimates that the nominal neutral rate of interest in Canada 
currently lies within a range of 2% to 3%—unchanged from the April 2022 
assessment. The midpoint estimate consists of a 2% inflation target and a 
0.5% real neutral rate.7
Because Canada is a small open economy, its real neutral rate of interest 
is influenced by global economic conditions. The Bank uses an estimate of 
the real neutral rate for the United States as a proxy for these. The US real 
neutral rate is estimated at 0.5%. The estimate is largely determined by the 
Bank’s view on US potential output growth and other factors that govern the 
US savings and investment balance.8 This estimate is unchanged from the 
April 2022 Report.9 
7	 For more details, see Champagne et al. (forthcoming).
8	 The Bank’s estimate for the nominal US neutral rate currently lies within a range of 2% to 3%.  
The 2% US inflation target accounts for 2 percentage points of this range.

X. S. Chen, C. Hajzler and A. Toktamyssov, “2020 US Neutral Rate Assessment,” Bank of Canada Staff 
Discussion Paper No. 2020-12 (December 2020). For more details on our most recent assessment, see

Notes: Estimates from the April 2022 assessment appear in parentheses. The COVID-19 pandemic has had 
both temporary and lasting effects on the supply side of the economy. The April 2022 Report distinguished 
between supply and potential output to account for the episodic nature of some decreases in supply caused 
by factors related to the pandemic, such as public health measures and supply chain disruptions. The 
elevated uncertainty about how long these factors will persist now makes this distinction artifi
 cially precise. 
The impact of these factors on potential output has been included in estimates of trend total factor productivity 
and trend labour input since the October 2022 Report. The range for potential output growth represents the 
methodological range implied by the risk scenarios presented in J. Champagne et al. (forthcoming).

In addition to the global real neutral rate, domestic factors can affect 
the estimate of the Canadian real neutral rate. These factors include 
demographic trends, potential output growth and the level of public debt.10 
However, the changes in these factors since the April 2022 Report have not 
affected the estimate for Canada. 
Like potential output, the real neutral rate is unobservable and can be inferred 
only by considering the evolution of its observed factors. Considerable 
uncertainty surrounds the midpoint estimate. This reflects the uncertainty 
around the factors that determine the real neutral rate, such as potential 
output and the balance between global savings and investment.

Model,” Bank of Canada Staff Discussion Paper No. 2023-5 (February 2023).
