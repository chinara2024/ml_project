CANADA’S INFLATION-CONTROL STRATEGY
Inflation control and the economy
• Inflation control is not an end in itself; it is the means whereby monetary
policy contributes to solid economic performance.
• Low inflation allows the economy to function more effectively. This con-
tributes to better economic growth over time and works to moderate
cyclical fluctuations in output and employment.
The monetary policy instrument
• Announcements regarding the Bank’s policy instrument—the target over-
night interest rate—take place, under normal circumstances, on eight pre-
specified dates during the year.
• In setting a target for the overnight rate, the Bank of Canada influences
short-term interest rates to achieve a rate of monetary expansion consis-
tent with the inflation-control target. The transmission mechanism is com-
plex and involves long and variable lags—the impact on inflation from
changes in policy rates is usually spread over six to eight quarters.
The targets
• In February 1991, the federal government and the Bank of Canada jointly
announced a series of targets for reducing total CPI inflation to the mid-
point of a range of 1 to 3 per cent by the end of 1995. That inflation-con-
trol target range was extended a number of times, most recently in May
2001, in this last case to the end of 2006. Monetary policy will continue to
aim at keeping future inflation at the 2 per cent target midpoint of this
range, both to maximize the likelihood that inflation stays within the tar-
get range and to increase the predictability of inflation over the longer
term (Crawford 2001).
Monitoring inflation
• In the short run, a good deal of movement in the CPI is caused by transi-
tory fluctuations in the prices of such volatile components as fruit and
gasoline, as well as by changes in indirect taxes. For this reason, the Bank
focuses on a core measure of CPI inflation that excludes the eight most vol-
atile components of the CPI and adjusts the remaining components to
remove the effect of changes in indirect taxes. Core inflation also tends to
be a better predictor of future changes in the total CPI than does the recent
history of CPI inflation (Macklem 2001).
The role of monetary policy is to facilitate
adjustments by helping to sustain aggregate
demand.
What does this mean? As always, it means that
we will aim to return inflation to its 2 per cent
target by trying to keep the economy operating
as close as possible to its full production capac-
ity. That is our constant goal. But it also means
that we will be aware of the forces that are driv-
ing adjustments in the economy in the years
ahead. We know that, with a stronger currency,
the economy will have to rely more on domestic
demand and less on foreign demand for ongo-
ing, solid growth. We will take this into account
as we set monetary policy.

1. OVERVIEW
The Canadian economy continues to adjust to developments in
the global economy. These include stronger world demand, higher
commodity prices, the realignment of world currencies—including
the Canadian dollar—and the intensified competition, together
with new trading opportunities, coming from emerging-market
economies, such as China and India.
These developments require shifts in activity among sectors
and create a need for adjustments by many businesses. Monetary
policy is facilitating these adjustments by supporting aggregate
demand, with the goal of keeping the economy near its full poten-
tial and inflation on target.
At the end of 2003, the Canadian economy was operating at a
lower level than the Bank had projected in the October Monetary
Policy Report. Although growth rebounded in the fourth quarter of
last year, real GDP growth in the third quarter was weaker than
had been expected, and there was a downward revision to GDP in
the second quarter. This came about despite stronger global eco-
nomic activity, particularly in the United States but also in Japan
and other Asian economies, and strong increases in commodity
prices. Preliminary indications are that growth in the first quarter
of 2004 was marginally below 3 per cent at annual rates. As
expected, core inflation has generally been below the Bank’s 2 per
cent target since the October Report.
Against this backdrop, the Bank lowered its key policy rate by a
total of 75 basis points, reducing it by 25 basis points on each of the
last three ﬁxed announcement dates, to bring it to 2 per cent (Chart 1).
The Bank’s outlook for economic growth and inflation in Can-
ada is essentially unchanged from that of the January Monetary
Policy Report Update. The Canadian economy is expected to grow at
an annualized rate of about 2 3/4 per cent in 2004, picking up to
about 3 3/4 per cent in 2005. Such growth would return the
economy close to its production potential by the third quarter of
next year. Core inflation is expected to average about 1 1/2 per
cent for the rest of 2004 and to move back to the 2 per cent target
by the end of next year.
The main uncertainty for the outlook continues to relate to how
the Canadian economy adjusts to global developments. Overall, the
risks to the outlook appear balanced.

2. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN INFLATION
The core rate of inflation fell in early 2004, and in February
was well below the Bank’s 2 per cent inflation-control target. The
rate of increase in the total CPI came down even more, reflecting
reductions in the prices of gasoline and fuel oil from year-earlier
levels.
Inflation and the 2 per cent target
Core inflation decreased
in early 2004.
As expected at the time of the October Report, core CPI inflation
fell in early 2004, as the effects of special factors came to an end
(Chart 2).1 Between August and December of 2003, the core rate
averaged 1.8 per cent, and by February it had decreased to 1.1 per
cent. Other measures of the trend rate of inflation that the Bank
follows closely have also fallen and in February were close to the
core rate (Chart 3).
1. The core measure of inﬂation excludes the eight most volatile components
of the CPI and adjusts the remaining components to remove the effect of
changes in indirect taxes. The eight most volatile components are fruit, vege-
tables, gasoline, fuel oil, natural gas, intercity transportation, tobacco, and
mortgage-interest costs.

A temporary jump in the core rate in December 2003 was the
result of Ontario electricity rebates at the end of 2002. In January and
February of 2004, the core rate of inﬂation moved lower, since the
effects from some special factors had, for the most part, ended. In
particular, the effect of past substantial increases in auto insurance
premiums, which had boosted the year-over-year rate of increase in
the core CPI for some time, diminished signiﬁcantly. The rate of
increase in the food component of the core CPI also came down early
this year, partly reﬂecting the impact of the Canadian dollar’s appre-
ciation since early 2003. Core inflation is expected to settle around
1 1/2 per cent in the second quarter of 2004.
The rate of increase in the
total CPI fell below 1 per
cent in February.
The 12-month rate of increase in the total CPI was 0.7 per cent in
February, down from 2.0 per cent in August. This drop relative to the
core rate was chiefly due to reductions in the consumer prices of
gasoline and fuel oil from their levels a year earlier, as well as a
marked easing in the year-to-year increase in the consumer price
of natural gas. The price of crude oil has strengthened considera-
bly since mid-October, however, reflecting strong Asian demand
and the impact of relatively severe winter weather conditions on
North American stocks. As a result, the price of oil is currently well
above that in the base-case assumption used in the last Report.

Factors at work on inflation
Aggregate demand
In the third quarter of
2003, economic growth in
Canada was somewhat
less than expected . . .
Canada’s real GDP grew at an annual rate of 1.3 per cent in the
third quarter of 2003, somewhat less than had been expected in
the October Report (Chart 4). In the fourth quarter, economic growth
picked up to an annual rate of 3.8 per cent, about the same as antici-
pated in the last Report and in the January Update, although ﬁnal
domestic demand was slightly weaker than expected and external
demand was slightly stronger. Recent indicators for spending and
activity suggest that economic growth will be about 2 3/4 per cent
in the first quarter of 2004, marginally weaker than anticipated in
the January Update.
. . . as manufacturers and
retailers made inventory
corrections.
Growth in the third quarter of 2003 was held back as manufactur-
ers and retailers undertook sharp inventory corrections (Chart 5).
Economic activity was also adversely affected by the August
blackout in Ontario and by the closure of international borders to
imports of Canadian cattle, beef, and related products after the
discovery of one case of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE)
last May. At the same time, final domestic demand rose strongly.
Business investment surged, and household spending rose sub-
stantially, reflecting continuing monetary stimulus, a high level
of consumer confidence (Chart 6), and the effects of price
discounting.

Growth rebounded
towards year-end,
as expected.
A pickup in inventory investment, together with some recovery
from the earlier unusual shocks, contributed importantly to the
resurgence in growth towards year-end.2 Exports also rebounded in
the fourth quarter of 2003 as a result of the strengthening global
economic recovery (Technical Box 1). However, imports increased
2. The discovery, near the end of last year, of a case of BSE in the United States
in a cow that originated in Alberta resulted in an extension of the ban on
imports of live cattle from Canada, thereby delaying further recovery in Can-
ada’s cattle industry.

Recent Trends in Export Volumes
In sharp contrast to their rapid expansion through the second half of the 1990s
and into 2000, exports of goods and services have been stagnant since early 2001,
reflecting a number of developments. The U.S. recession and the uneven U.S. recovery
until mid-2003 adversely affected export growth. Another important factor was the
global collapse in demand for many types of capital goods, especially in the informa-
tion and communications technology sector. There has also been pronounced weak-
ness in the demand for aircraft and parts in the aftermath of 11 September 2001. Other
developments have been the result of smaller and more temporary shocks: lower
grain exports, because of poor harvests in 2001 and 2002; the BSE-related import ban
on Canadian cattle and beef from late May 2003 onwards (which was partially lifted
in late September 2003); and a sharp decline in the demand for travel and transportation
services in the first half of 2003 because of the war with Iraq and the SARS outbreak.
Canada also appears to have lost market share for some products to foreign com-
petition. In particular, exports of office machines and equipment declined relative to
corresponding U.S. investment in 2001 and 2002, possibly reflecting more intense
competition from low-cost emerging markets, as well as lower capacity utilization in
the United States. More recently, the appreciation of the Canadian dollar appears to
have exacerbated downward pressure on some exports, including industrial machinery.
Total exports rebounded late in 2003. This reflected a recovery from some of the
previous shocks, as well as a rapid advance in exports of raw and industrial materials
in response to the recovery in global industrial activity and commodity prices. The
rebound was also seen in exports of office machines and equipment, supported by
sharp growth in U.S. spending on these items. A recovery in exports of travel services
in the second half of the year was consistent with the dissipation of earlier shocks, but
because of an even larger increase in imports of travel services, perhaps reflecting the
appreciation of the Canadian dollar, the travel balance worsened over this period.

even more strongly, and growth in final domestic demand slowed
from its rapid pace in the third quarter.
In the United States, an upswing in household spending on
housing and consumption and in business spending on equipment
and software led to strong growth of real GDP in the second half of
2003 (8.2 and 4.1 per cent in the third and fourth quarters, respec-
tively). Based on preliminary information, additional household
spending, strong business expenditures, and significant restocking
of inventories should result in growth of about 4 1/2 per cent in the
first quarter of 2004 (Chart 7).
Adjusting to global change
Key global developments
and the resulting rise in
the Canadian dollar . . .
Among the key global developments affecting the Canadian
economy in 2003 and early 2004 has been the marked realignment
of world currencies, including the Canadian dollar. At the same
time, there has been a significant strengthening in the pace of global
economic growth, especially in the United States and in most Asian
economies, and a rebound in world commodity prices. The growing
presence of China and India on the global scene is also a factor at
play. The implications of these global changes for the demand for
Canadian products will require shifts in activity among sectors
and significant adjustments by many firms.

growth in Canada will
rely largely on domestic

The rise in the Canadian dollar implies that economic growth
in Canada will rely largely on domestic demand. Indeed, eco-
nomic activity in the last quarter of 2003 and in early 2004 appears
to have been held back by the impact of the Canadian dollar’s
appreciation on real net exports. In addition, there are likely to be

shifts in activity towards the export of commodities and away
from the export of highly manufactured products. Moreover, some
Canadian exporters are likely to shift towards markets in countries
whose currencies have appreciated significantly in relation to the
U.S. dollar. The reduction in the cost of machinery and equipment
imported from the United States should help boost capital spend-
ing
and
improve
Canadian
productivity.
Finally,
firms
will
develop new supply chains and new niches for their own products
and services in response to changing global markets.
Some of the economic adjustments in Canada caused by the
key global changes became evident in 2003, although most of
these shifts in activity across sectors are still to come. While over-
all corporate profitability remained high through 2003, profits
have tended to weaken in those sectors with high exposure to
international competition (Technical Box 2). Output growth was
also stronger, and employment tended to rise, on average, in those
industries producing commodities or having low exposure to
foreign competition.
Many firms adversely
affected by the rise in the
Canadian dollar have
already initiated
measures to alleviate
its impact.
The Bank’s most recent industry survey, completed in March,
provides further evidence that changes in response to global
developments have begun.3 Firms seemed somewhat more confi-
dent in their ability to adjust to the appreciation of the Canadian
dollar. Many adversely affected firms have initiated measures to
alleviate the impact of the higher dollar, chiefly through cost-cut-
ting measures and improvements to productivity. In contrast, busi-
nesses favourably affected by the higher value of the dollar
(mainly through lower costs for imported inputs) have responded,
in some cases, by reducing their selling prices in Canada, although
many used the opportunity to improve their profit margins. Com-
panies that were adversely affected by the rise in the Canadian dollar
were generally as optimistic as other ﬁrms regarding prospects for
improved sales growth, but were markedly less sanguine about their
hiring and investment intentions.
Estimated pressures on capacity
The level of economic
activity in Canada has
been below potential
since the second quarter
of 2003.
Estimates of the Bank’s conventional measures of potential
output and the output gap suggest that the level of economic
activity has been below potential since the second quarter of 2003
(Chart 8). While the output gap decreased somewhat in the fourth
quarter, significant excess supply remains. With a downward
revision to Canadian GDP data in the second quarter of 2003 and

Adjusting to Global Change: Sectoral Developments in Canada in 2003
In 2003, changes in proﬁtability and output differed widely among various
sectors in Canada. This reflected several factors linked to the adjustment to
global change. The higher Canadian dollar, the strengthening global economy,
the associated rise in world commodity prices, and the continuing growth and
integration of such major emerging-market economies as China and India have
had markedly different effects on different sectors of the Canadian economy.
Shifts in proﬁtability and activity among sectors also initiated major changes in
the sectoral distribution of employment.
Firms in sectors where prices are determined in world markets (and denomi-
nated in U.S. dollars) and which made limited use of hedging, quickly felt the
impact of the dollar’s appreciation on proﬁtability. Indeed, while aggregate prof-
itability remained high in 2003, the average rate of return on equity in those sec-
tors with a relatively high, positive exposure to international trade worsened
markedly in the second half of 2003.1 The reduction in proﬁtability was particu-
larly pronounced in industries producing non-electrical machinery, clothing, and
textiles. The rise in proﬁtability over the past year was concentrated in sectors
with a low or negative net exposure to international trade (such as wholesale and
retail trade and the ﬁnancial sector).
1. Net exposure to international trade is calculated by adding the proportion of produc-
tion that is exported and the share of imports in domestic consumption, and subtracting
the share of imported inputs in production, as in Dion (1999–2000). For instance, sectors
that are highly export oriented or highly exposed to import competition would be said to
be more positively exposed to international trade.

Technical Box 2 (continued)
All else being equal, a rise in the Canadian dollar would be expected to
reduce the external demand for Canadian-produced goods and services. Indeed,
over the past year, output growth in sectors highly exposed to international trade
was somewhat lower than output growth in the rest of the business sector. Out-
put fell sharply in the non-electrical machinery, clothing, and textile manufactur-
ing industries. At the same time, in a number of these industries, the global
economic recovery offset some of the adverse impact on overall demand for their
products. For instance, output rose strongly in mining, primary metals manufac-
turing, and electronics and computer manufacturing over the past year. Strong
growth in Canada’s ﬁnal domestic demand during the past year also boosted
activity in several sectors with a low exposure to international trade, such as
printing and publishing, construction, and wholesale trade.
The prolonged weakness in proﬁtability for many ﬁrms in the industries with
a high, positive exposure to international trade caused many of them to begin
adjusting their operations in 2003. Employment in most of these industries fell
back noticeably last year, while employment rose substantially in various sectors
with a low exposure to international trade, such as construction; wholesale and
retail trade; and ﬁnance, insurance, and real estate.

lower-than-expected growth in the second half of that year, the esti-
mated output gap at year-end was somewhat larger than projected in
the last Report.
Several indicators are consistent with the view that economic
slack has opened up since early 2003. In the most recent survey
conducted by the Bank’s regional offices, the proportion of firms
reporting pressures on capacity has decreased relative to indica-
tions at the beginning of 2003. As well, core inflation has moved
below the 2 per cent target. On the other hand, capacity utilization
in the non-farm, goods-producing sector in the fourth quarter of 2003
was, on balance, largely unchanged from levels early in the year, and
about the same as its 2000–2003 average.
Based on an analysis of all the indicators of capacity pressures,
the Bank judges that there is currently more excess supply in the
Canadian economy than indicated by its conventional measure. How-
ever, there is more uncertainty than usual around estimates of the
output gap, because it is harder to pin down effective capacity in
times of demand-driven shifts in sectoral activity.

Cost control and output prices
Unit labour costs in the
fourth quarter of 2003
were virtually unchanged
from year-earlier levels.
The underlying increase in
wages is about 2 3/4 per
cent.
Unit labour costs in the business sector in the fourth quarter
of 2003 were virtually unchanged from year-earlier levels, even
though there was only a small rise in productivity over the past
year (Chart 9). This resulted from the fact that hourly labour
compensation in the business sector was little changed between
the fourth quarter of 2002 and the fourth quarter of 2003. This
weakness in the rate of increase of compensation was particularly
pronounced in sectors adversely affected by the series of unusual
shocks that hit the Canadian economy in 2003 and is therefore
likely to prove temporary. Indeed, the underlying rate of increase
in wages, based on such measures as the average hourly earnings
of permanent workers, seems to have moved up to about 2 3/4 per
cent since mid-2003 (Chart 10).4
4. The average annual wage increase negotiated in the public sector in January
2004 was relatively high, but the number of employees covered by the new
contracts was much lower than usual.

The substantial year-over-year increases in the global prices of
Canada’s commodity exports during 2003 pushed the annual rise in
the chain price index for GDP (a broad price measure of the goods
and services produced in Canada) above the core rate of inﬂation last
year (Chart 11). The prices of non-energy commodities have risen fur-
ther since the end of 2003 (Chart 12). Strong Asian demand has
helped maintain the prices of both metals and grains at high levels.
At the same time, expectations of continued strong demand for hous-
ing in North America for 2004 and a desire by U.S. lumber wholesal-
ers to restore inventories to more normal levels contributed to a
sharp rise in lumber prices.

3. FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Financial conditions have
continued to improve.
Financial conditions in Canada, as in the rest of the world gen-
erally, have continued the improvement noted in the October
Report. Stock markets have strengthened further, corporate bond
spreads are narrower, and the yield curve has shifted down. The
financial situations and profitability of banks in Canada remain
healthy—a positive sign for future credit conditions—and there is
an abundance of liquidity.
Credit demand by non-financial businesses picked up in the
past few months but remains modest, since growth in earnings has
allowed businesses to finance most of their investment needs with
internal funds (Chart 13). Longer-term business credit, buoyed by
the strong issuance of bonds and the income-trust component of
equities, has grown at a solid pace, but short-term credit remains
below levels of a year ago.
Household credit is still expanding at a rapid pace, reflecting
consumer spending and activity in the housing market. Low inter-
est rates have held debt-service ratios at low levels, and rising
house prices have supported household balance sheets. This sug-
gests that household finances should not be a drag on economic
growth in the period ahead.

The yield curve in Canada has shifted down since the October
Report. At shorter maturities, this movement reflected both the
actual and anticipated lowering of policy rates.
Yield spreads between Canadian and U.S. bonds at shorter
maturities narrowed sharply in the period between October
and February, as interest rates fell in Canada while yields on U.S.
Treasuries remained fairly stable (Chart 14). This narrowing in
spreads was particularly pronounced for 2-year maturities.
Since February, spreads have remained relatively stable.
The Canadian dollar has
traded in a wide but sta-
ble range since October.
The period from October to January saw broad-based weak-
ness in the U.S. dollar relative to most currencies. In this context,
the Canadian dollar touched a 10-year high of 78.86 cents U.S. in
early January (Chart 15). Since then, many currencies, including
the Canadian dollar, have traded in fairly wide but more stable
ranges. The Canadian dollar traded in a range of 74 1/2 to 76 1/2 cents
U.S., similar to the level at the time of the October Report.

4. THE OUTLOOK
International background
The global economic
recovery is gaining
momentum . . .
The recovery in global economic activity is broadening and
gaining momentum. This is reflected in both official and private
sector forecasts. This recovery is strongly supported by expansion-
ary fiscal and monetary policies in many countries. It is also being
driven by the continuing integration into the world economy of
major emerging-market economies such as China and India.
Indeed, the contribution of China and newly industrialized Asian
economies to projected world economic growth is larger than that
of the United States (see Table 1).
Short-term prospects for strong growth in the United States
have improved. The Bank expects to see growth of about 5 per
cent in 2004 and 4 1/2 per cent in 2005. The main drivers of U.S.
growth will be robust investment and consumer spending. Firms
are expected to plow back their profits to meet anticipated
demand and replenish their inventories. And households will ben-
efit from tax rebates and projected employment gains. However,
should they persist, high oil prices would dampen U.S. growth
prospects over the next two years.

Although much remains to be done in terms of economic and
ﬁnancial reform, a sustained recovery in Japan may be in progress
boosted by strong exports and investment. While prospects appear to
be improving in the euro area, the near-term outlook remains sub-
dued. In contrast, the U.K. economy is operating at close to full
capacity. Among emerging markets, growth prospects for China and
India are very favourable.
While the short-term outlook is clearly more positive, risks
and uncertainties remain as we look further out. It is unclear, for
example, whether the large fiscal and current account imbalances
in many major economies will be resolved in a way that maintains
growth.
. . . supporting the prices of
non-energy commodities.
The expected strong economic expansion, especially in various
Asian economies, should continue to support the price of non-
energy commodities over the remainder of 2004 and through 2005.
With regard to crude oil, the Bank’s base-case scenario assumes that
prices will ease to about US$32 per barrel by the middle of this year
and remain there through mid-2005. Natural gas prices are expected
to stay near their current high levels throughout 2004. These
assumptions, based on current futures prices, are significantly
above the levels of six months ago (Chart 16).

Aggregate demand and supply in Canada
Economic growth in
Canada will come
mainly from private
domestic demand.
Economic growth in Canada in 2004 and 2005 is expected to
come primarily from private domestic demand, supported by the
degree of monetary stimulus and high levels of business and con-
sumer confidence. The expanding global economy and the result-
ing high level of commodity prices, the contribution of the higher
Canadian dollar to reduced costs of imported machinery and
equipment, and favourable financial conditions should all lead to
robust growth in capital expenditures by businesses. And, despite
some softening towards the end of 2003, household spending is still
expected to grow solidly, with additional support from projected
stronger gains in real incomes. Spending on goods and services by all
levels of government is projected to rise moderately during this
period.
Canadian exports are expected to receive continued support
from further strong gains in U.S. and global economic activity.
Nonetheless, the lower value of the U.S. dollar is expected to hold
back the growth of Canada’s exports and boost imports. Indeed,
net exports are not expected to contribute to growth in 2004 and 2005
(Table 2).

Growth is expected to
strengthen this year and
next . . .
The Bank’s base-case outlook now projects real GDP growth, on
an average annual basis, of about 2 3/4 per cent in 2004, picking
up to about 3 3/4 per cent in 2005. While lower than that given in
the October Report, the projection for 2004 is the same as that in
the January Update. This projection for 2004 is also very close to
the most recent average private sector forecast, while the Bank’s
growth projection for 2005 is slightly higher than the latest con-
sensus outlook.
. . . with the economy
operating near potential
by the third quarter of
2005.
The Bank’s projection assumes real GDP growth of about
2 3/4 per cent, at an annual rate, in the first half of 2004. This is
expected to move up to about 3 1/2 per cent in the second half of
this year and to peak around 4 per cent in the first half of 2005.
This outlook for growth would imply little change in the output
gap by the end of 2004, but by the third quarter of 2005 the econ-
omy should be operating near potential.
The main uncertainty for the outlook continues to relate to how the
Canadian economy adjusts to global developments. Overall, the risks
to the outlook appear balanced.
Measures of inflation expectations
Most measures of infla-
tion expectations have
changed little since
mid-October.
Most indicators of inflation expectations that the Bank follows
have remained largely unchanged since mid-October, and many of
the key medium- and longer-term measures remain close to 2 per
cent. In the Conference Board of Canada’s regular survey, reported
in the winter issue of Index of Business Confidence, 84 per cent of
respondents expected prices, in general, to rise over the next six
months at a rate of 2 per cent or less, little changed from last
autumn. As well, almost all firms in the Bank’s latest regional sur-
vey expected CPI inflation to be within a range of 1 to 3 per cent,
on average, over the next two years. Although the average private
sector forecast for total CPI inflation in 2004 has edged down fur-
ther to 1.4 per cent, the inflation forecast for 2005 is just under
2 per cent. Typical forecasts of longer-term inflation also remain
very close to 2 per cent.
Implications of money growth for inflation
Growth in narrow money
is consistent with the
near-term outlook . . .
Growth in the narrow money aggregates—M1+, M1++—has
strengthened since the last Report, partly in response to the low
interest rate environment. This robust growth is widespread across
both household and business deposits. This is consistent with the
near-term outlook and with the recent pickup in output growth
(Chart 17).
 M O N E T A R Y  P O L I C Y  R E P O R T — A P R I L  2 0 0 4
27
. . . while weak growth in
M2++ points to a down-
side risk for inflation.
The growth rate of the broad money aggregate, M2++, has
risen somewhat since the last Report from relatively low levels
(Chart 18). This upswing largely reflects the strong growth in nar-
row money. Also contributing was a shift back into equity-based
mutual funds from other assets, reversing the trend of the past
few months. Despite this recent pickup, continued weak growth in
M2++ points to a downside risk for inflation.

Inflation projection
Core inflation is expected
to remain around 1 1/2 per
cent through 2004 . . .
The slack in product and labour markets is expected to keep
inflation below longer-term expectations until mid-2005. This
effect should gradually diminish, however, as the output gap
closes. The rise in the Canadian dollar since early 2003 is also
likely to continue to put a limited amount of downward pressure
on the core rate over the remainder of 2004.
. . . before moving back to
about 2 per cent by the
end of 2005.
The core rate of inflation is expected to stay around 1 1/2 per
cent through 2004, before gradually moving back to the 2 per cent
target by the end of 2005 (Table 3).5
Total CPI inflation is
projected to stay near the
core rate after mid-2004.
The outlook for the 12-month rate of increase in the total CPI is
critically affected by developments in the markets for crude oil
(Chart 16). With the substantial rise in the price of crude oil in recent
months, total CPI inﬂation is expected to move somewhat above the
core rate of inﬂation in the second quarter of 2004. If the WTI price
of oil eases to about US$32 per barrel by mid-2004 and to
US$30 per barrel by the second half of 2005, as suggested by
futures prices, total CPI inflation should fall slightly below core
inflation in 2005.
5. In April 2004, the 12-month rate of increase in the core CPI is expected to
rise temporarily, given that a second rebate on Ontario electricity prices low-
ered the level of the core CPI in April 2003.
