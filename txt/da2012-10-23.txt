The Bank of Canada today announced that it is maintaining its target for the
overnight rate at 1 per cent. The Bank Rate is correspondingly 1 1/4 per cent and
the deposit rate is 3/4 per cent.
The global economy has unfolded broadly as the Bank projected in its July
Monetary Policy Report (MPR). The economic expansion in the United States is
progressing at a gradual pace. Europe is in recession and recent indicators point
to a continued contraction. In China and other major emerging economies,
growth has slowed somewhat more than expected, though there are signs of
stabilization around current growth rates. Notwithstanding the slowdown in
global economic activity, prices for oil and other commodities produced in Canada
have, on average, increased in recent months.  Global financial conditions have
improved, supported by aggressive policy actions of major central banks, but
sentiment remains fragile.
In Canada, while global headwinds continue to restrain economic activity,
domestic factors are supporting a moderate expansion. Following the recent
period of below-potential growth, the economy is expected to pick up and return
to full capacity by the end of 2013. The Bank continues to project that the
expansion will be driven mainly by growth in consumption and business
investment, reflecting very stimulative domestic financial conditions. Housing
activity is expected to decline from historically high levels, while the household
debt burden is expected to rise further before stabilizing by the end of the
projection horizon. Canadian exports are projected to pick up gradually but
remain below their pre-recession peak until the first half of 2014, reflecting weak
foreign demand and ongoing competitiveness challenges.  These challenges
include the persistent strength of the Canadian dollar, which is being influenced
by safe haven flows and spillovers from global monetary policy.
After taking into account revisions to the National Accounts, the Bank projects
that the economy will grow by 2.2 per cent in 2012, 2.3 per cent in 2013 and 2.4
per cent in 2014.

Core inflation has been lower than expected in recent months, reflecting
somewhat softer prices across a wide range of goods and services.  Core inflation
is expected to increase gradually over coming quarters, reaching 2 per cent by the
middle of 2013 as the economy gradually absorbs the current small degree of
slack, the growth of labour compensation remains moderate and inflation
expectations stay well-anchored. Total CPI inflation has fallen noticeably below
the 2 per cent target, as expected, and is projected to return to target by the end
of 2013, somewhat later than previously anticipated.
Reflecting all of these factors, the Bank has decided to maintain the target for the
overnight rate at 1 per cent. Over time, some modest withdrawal of monetary
policy stimulus will likely be required, consistent with achieving the 2 per cent
inflation target.  The timing and degree of any such withdrawal will be weighed
carefully against global and domestic developments, including the evolution of
imbalances in the household sector.
