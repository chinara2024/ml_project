The Bank of Canada today announced that it is maintaining its target for the
overnight rate at 1 per cent. The Bank Rate is correspondingly 1 1/4 per cent and
the deposit rate is 3/4 per cent.
The global economic recovery is proceeding largely as expected, although risks
have increased. As anticipated, private domestic demand in the United States is
picking up slowly, while growth in emerging-market economies has begun to ease
to a more sustainable, but still robust, pace. In Europe, recent data have been
consistent with a modest recovery. At the same time, there is an increased risk
that sovereign debt concerns in several countries could trigger renewed strains in
global financial markets.
The recovery in Canada is proceeding at a moderate pace, although economic
activity in the second half of 2010 appears slightly weaker than the Bank projected
in its October Monetary Policy Report. In the third quarter, household spending
was stronger than the Bank had anticipated and growth in business investment
was robust. However, net exports were weaker than projected and continued to
exert a significant drag on growth. This underlines a previously-identified risk that
a combination of disappointing productivity performance and persistent strength
in the Canadian dollar could dampen the expected recovery of net exports.
Inflation dynamics in Canada have been broadly in line with the Bank's
expectations and the underlying pressures affecting prices remain largely
unchanged.
Reflecting all of these factors, the Bank has decided to maintain the target for the
overnight rate at 1 per cent. This leaves considerable monetary stimulus in place,
consistent with achieving the 2 per cent inflation target in an environment of
significant excess supply in Canada. Any further reduction in monetary policy
stimulus would need to be carefully considered.
