MONETARY POLICY REPORT
UPDATE
– January 2004 –
This text is a commentary of the Governing Council of the Bank of Canada.
It presents the Bank’s updated outlook based on information received
between 15 October 2003 and 19 January 2004.
Since the October Monetary Policy Re-
port, three developments have led the Bank
of Canada to modify its outlook for eco-
nomic growth and inflation in Canada.
First, economic activity in the rest of the
world, especially in the United States, has
been stronger than expected. Second, the
U.S. dollar has continued its sharp depreci-
ation against major world currencies, in-
cluding the Canadian dollar, largely as a
result
of
global
economic
imbalances.
Third, downward revisions to Canadian
GDP data in the first half of 2003 and lower-
than-expected growth in the third and
fourth quarters mean that the amount of
economic slack was somewhat larger at the
end of 2003 than projected by the Bank in
its October Report.
Weighing
these
developments
and
their likely persistence, the Bank lowered
its projection for output over the next year
and a half and concluded that additional
monetary stimulus would be required to
support aggregate demand and return in-
flation to 2 per cent over the medium term.
Thus, on 20 January, the Bank lowered its
target for the overnight interest rate by
25 basis points to 2 1/2 per cent (Chart 1).
But risks remain. The main uncertain-
ties for the Canadian economic outlook re-
late to the adjustment to global changes.
These include a stronger world economy,
higher commodity prices, and the realign-
ment of world currencies, including the Ca-
nadian dollar. In this context, the role of
monetary policy is to support aggregate
demand sufficient to eliminate the output
gap, so as to return inflation to its target
over a two-year horizon.
Highlights
• The Bank has lowered its projection
for output over the next year and a half
and has provided additional monetary
stimulus.
• After mid-2004, the Canadian economy
is projected to grow faster than
capacity, relying primarily on private
domestic demand.
• The economy is projected to return to
close to full production capacity by the
third quarter of 2005, and inﬂation
should return to its 2 per cent target
late in that year.
• The main uncertainties in the outlook
relate to the adjustment to global
changes.

Overview of Recent Economic
and Financial Developments
A global economic recovery, led by the
United States, appears to be well underway
and is proceeding at a somewhat stronger
pace than was expected.
Canada’s real GDP, after edging down
in the second quarter of 2003, grew at an
annual rate of only 1.1 per cent in the third
quarter—a weaker result than projected in
the last Report. Recent indicators for spend-
ing and activity point to a strengthening in
the pace of economic expansion in the fourth
quarter, with growth at about 4 per cent
(Chart 2)—a rate above that of potential.

The modest rate of growth in the third
quarter largely reflected a sharp inventory
correction by manufacturers and retailers
(Chart 3). Economic activity was also ad-
versely affected by the August blackout in
Ontario and by the closure of international
borders to imports of Canadian cattle, beef,
and related products after the discovery of
one case of bovine spongiform encephalop-
athy (BSE) in May.
The completion of the inventory correc-
tion, together with the recovery from these
unusual shocks,1 contributed importantly
to the estimated rebound in growth in the
fourth quarter. More generally, various as-
pects of the current climate, including ro-
bust employment gains and favourable
financial conditions, suggest that stronger,
more sustainable economic growth re-
sumed in the fourth quarter of 2003.
Against this backdrop, the Canadian
dollar has appreciated further against the
U.S. dollar since last October, touching a
ten-year high of 78.84 cents and averaging
76.5 cents over the period. On a trade-
weighted basis, the movement has been
somewhat less, given the relatively large
1.
The recent discovery of a case of BSE in the United States in a
cow that originated in Alberta has led to an extension of the ban
on imports of live cattle from Canada, thereby delaying the
recovery of Canada’s cattle industry.

depreciation of the U.S. dollar against over-
seas currencies. Of note, the Canadian dol-
lar has depreciated 4 1/2 per cent against
the euro over the last three months. Over-
all, the stronger Canadian dollar appears to
have begun to cut into the pace of economic
activity in terms of weaker-than-expected
export growth and signs of greater import
penetration in the fourth quarter.
The Bank’s conventional measures of
potential output and the output gap indi-
cate that the level of economic activity fell
below full capacity in the second and third
quarters of 2003 (Chart 4). And, while the
amount of economic slack probably de-
creased somewhat in the fourth quarter,
significant excess supply remains. Based on
an analysis of all the indicators of capacity
pressures, the size of the output gap is
judged to be slightly larger than the con-
ventional measure suggests.
Even with a lower level of output and a
strong Canadian dollar, core inflation (at
1.8 per cent in November) was slightly
higher than projected in our October Report
and up somewhat since August (Chart 5).
The positive surprise in the core rate main-
ly reflected less price discounting of auto-
mobiles and clothing than expected; it
should be temporary.

Core CPI inflation is likely to continue
to exhibit some near-term volatility—rising
in December before falling in the first quar-
ter of 2004. These movements will mainly
reflect the effects of special factors a year
ago.2 If one looks through these influences,
however, underlying price pressures and
the presence of unutilized capacity suggest
a core rate of inflation below current levels.
The 12-month rate of increase in the to-
tal CPI was 1.6 per cent in November, down
from 2.0 per cent in August. This decrease
in total CPI inflation was chiefly due to re-
ductions in the consumer prices of gasoline
and fuel oil from their levels a year earlier.
Adjusting to Global Changes
The stronger Canadian dollar largely
reflects a response to global economic and
financial forces. These include not only ele-
ments reflecting stronger world demand,
such as higher world commodity prices,
but also the adjustments associated with
redressing global economic imbalances.
The stronger dollar means that the Ca-
nadian economy will be relying less on net
exports and more on domestic demand.

For example, the 12-month rate of increase in the core CPI is
expected to rise temporarily in December 2003, given that the
ﬁrst rebate on Ontario electricity prices lowered the level of the
core CPI in December 2002.

This will require shifts in activity among
sectors and changes on the part of many
businesses. The Bank’s recent regional sur-
vey suggests that these changes are under-
way. In particular, it indicates that firms
affected by the appreciation have made
plans to adjust—for example, by installing
new machinery and equipment.
Canadian monetary policy facilitates
the overall adjustment process by helping
to sustain aggregate demand.
Economic Prospects
The global economic expansion is
expected to strengthen over the next year
or so, although economic imbalances still
create uncertainty about its sustainability.
Growth in U.S. real GDP is projected to
remain above the economy’s growth poten-
tial in 2004, supported by stimulative poli-
cies and the depreciation of the U.S. dollar.
Strengthening capital spending by busi-
nesses, combined with a considerable con-
tribution
from
inventory
investment,
should underpin the expansion in activity.
The Bank expects that U.S. economic activ-
ity will increase by about 4 1/2 per cent in
2004, on an average annual basis, which is
somewhat stronger than was projected in
the October Report. And, while prospects
for sustained U.S. economic growth are
clouded by the accumulation of fiscal and
external imbalances, U.S. output growth is
projected to remain above that of potential
in 2005.
In the euro area, a gradual pickup in
economic momentum is projected, while
conditions in Japan should continue to im-
prove, largely because of exports to the rest
of Asia, especially China. Strong growth in
emerging Asian markets should also con-
tinue to support U.S.-dollar prices for many
commodities.
In Canada, economic growth in the
period ahead will come primarily from
private domestic demand, supported by
monetary stimulus and by strong business
confidence. Growth in household spending
should also be underpinned by rising em-
ployment and incomes. A stronger global
economy, the reduced cost of machinery
and equipment resulting from the higher
Canadian dollar, and ready access to capi-
tal markets should stimulate stronger busi-
ness investment. Exports should receive
some support from rising U.S. and global
economic
activity,
notwithstanding
a
marked reduction, since 2001, in the U.S.
propensity to import. However, the lower
value of the U.S. dollar is expected to put
continuing downward pressure on Canadi-
an exports over the course of 2004.
The Bank’s base-case projection now
calls for real GDP growth in Canada to
average about 2 3/4 per cent in 2004 (com-
pared with 1.6 per cent in 2003), and to
pick up to about 3 3/4 per cent in 2005.
The Bank’s projection assumes growth of
about 3 per cent, at an annual rate, in the
first half of 2004, moving to 3–3 1
/2 per cent
in the second half and peaking around
4 per cent in the first half of 2005. This
would imply that the output gap would not
change materially before the end of 2004,
but would be substantially closed by the
third quarter of 2005.
The Outlook for Inﬂation
Core inflation is projected to fall below
1.5 per cent in early 2004 (as the effect of
past substantial increases in auto insurance
premiums rapidly diminishes) before grad-
ually moving back towards the 2 per cent
target (Table 1) by the end of 2005.
The slack in product and labour
markets
should
keep
inflation
below
longer-run inflation expectations over the
next year and a half. But this effect should
disappear as the output gap closes.
The appreciation of the Canadian
dollar over the last year is likely to continue
to temper the rise in consumer prices

through 2004. However, the extent of the
pass-through of exchange rate movements
to consumer prices is expected to be limit-
ed, based on the experience here in Canada
and in other countries with low and stable
inflation.
The outlook for the 12-month rate of in-
crease in the total CPI continues to be im-
portantly affected by developments in the
markets for crude oil. If oil prices ease to
about US$30 per barrel in the second half of
2004 and US$28 in 2005, as suggested by
forward contracts, total CPI inflation should
remain below core inflation through 2005.
