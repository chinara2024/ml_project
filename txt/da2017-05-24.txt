The Bank of Canada is maintaining its target for the overnight rate at 1/2 per cent.
The Bank Rate is correspondingly 3/4 per cent and the deposit rate is 1/4 per cent.
Inflation is broadly in line with the Bank’s projection in its April Monetary Policy
Report (MPR). Food prices continue to decline, mainly because of intense retail
competition, pushing inflation temporarily lower. The Bank’s three measures of
core inflation remain below two per cent and wage growth is still subdued,
consistent with ongoing excess capacity in the economy.
The global economy continues to gain traction and recent developments reinforce
the Bank’s view that growth will gradually strengthen and broaden over the
projection horizon. As anticipated, growth in the United States during the first
quarter was weak, reflecting mostly temporary factors. Recent data point to a
rebound in the second quarter.  The uncertainties outlined in the April MPR
continue to cloud the global and Canadian outlooks.
The Canadian economy’s adjustment to lower oil prices is largely complete and
recent economic data have been encouraging, including indicators of business
investment. Consumer spending and the housing sector continue to be robust on
the back of an improving labour market, and these are becoming more broadly
based across regions. Macroprudential and other policy measures, while
contributing to more sustainable debt profiles, have yet to have a substantial
cooling effect on housing markets. Meanwhile, export growth remains subdued,
as anticipated in the April MPR, in the face of ongoing competitiveness challenges.
The Bank’s monitoring of the economic data suggests that very strong growth in
the first quarter will be followed by some moderation in the second quarter.
All things considered, Governing Council judges that the current degree of
monetary stimulus is appropriate at present, and maintains the target for the
overnight rate at 1/2 per cent.
