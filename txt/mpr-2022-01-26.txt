Canada’s infl
 ation-control strategy
Infl
 ation targeting and the economy
 

The objective of Canada's monetary policy is to promote the 
economic and fi
 nancial well-being of Canadians. Canada’s 
experience with infl
 ation targeting since 1991 has shown that the 
best way that monetary policy can achieve this goal is by maintaining 
a low and stable infl
 ation environment. Doing so fosters confi
 dence 
in the value of money and contributes to sustained economic growth, 
a strong and inclusive labour market and improved living standards.
 

In 2021, the Government of Canada and the Bank of Canada 
renewed the fl
 exible infl
 ation-targeting framework for a further 
fi
 ve-year period, ending December 31, 2026.1 
 

The infl
 ation target was renewed at the 2% midpoint of the 1%–3% 
control range, with infl
 ation measured as the 12-month rate of 
change in the consumer price index (CPI). 
 

The Government and the Bank agreed that the best contribution 
monetary policy can make to the economic and fi
 nancial 
well-being of Canadians is to continue to focus on price stability. 
The Government and the Bank also agreed that monetary policy 
should continue to support maximum sustainable employment, 
recognizing that maximum sustainable employment is not directly 
measurable and is determined largely by non-monetary factors 
that can change through time. 
 

Further, the Government and the Bank agreed that because 
well-anchored infl
 ation expectations are critical to achieving both 
price stability and maximum sustainable employment, the primary 
objective of monetary policy is to maintain low, stable infl
 ation over 
time. 
Infl
 ation targeting is symmetric and ﬂ
 exible
 

Canada’s infl
 ation-targeting approach is symmetric, which means 
the Bank is equally concerned about infl
 ation rising above or falling 
below the 2% target. 
 

Canada’s infl
 ation-targeting framework is also ﬂ
 exible. Typically, 
the Bank seeks to return infl
 ation to target over a horizon of six to 
eight quarters. However, the most appropriate horizon for returning 
infl
 ation to target will vary depending on the nature and persistence 
of the shocks buffeting the economy.
 

The 2021 agreement with the Government specifi
 es that the 2% 
infl
 ation target remains the cornerstone of the framework. 
 

The agreement further notes that the Bank will continue to use the 
fl
 exibility of the 1%–3% control range to actively seek the maximum 
sustainable level of employment, when conditions warrant. The Bank 
will also continue to leverage the fl
 exibility inherent in the framework 
to help address the challenges of structurally low interest rates by 
using a broad set of policy tools. The Bank will use this fl
 exibility only 
to an extent that is consistent with keeping medium-term infl
 ation 
expectations well anchored at 2%.
Monetary policy tools
 

Because monetary policy actions take time to work their way through 
the economy and have their full effect on infl
 ation, monetary policy 
must be forward-looking.
 

The Bank normally carries out monetary policy through changes 
in the target for the overnight rate of interest (the policy rate). The 
Bank also has a range of monetary policy tools it can use when the 
policy rate is at very low levels. These tools consist of guidance on 
the future evolution of the policy rate, large-scale asset purchases 
(quantitative easing and credit easing), funding for credit measures, 
and negative policy rates. The potential use and sequencing of these 
tools would depend on the economic and fi
 nancial market context.
 

All of the Bank’s monetary policy tools affect total demand for 
Canadian goods and services through their infl
 uence on market 
interest rates, domestic asset prices and the exchange rate. The 
balance between this demand and the economy’s production 
capacity is, over time, the main factor that determines infl
 ation 
pressures in the economy.
Communications
 

Consistent with its commitment to clear, transparent communications, 
the Bank regularly reports its perspectives on the economy and 
infl
 ation. Policy decisions are typically announced on eight pre-set 
days during the year, and full updates of the Bank’s outlook are 
published four times each year in the Monetary Policy Report.
 

The Bank is committed to explaining when it is using the fl
 exibility of 
the infl
 ation-targeting framework.
 

Given the uncertainty about the maximum sustainable level of 
employment, the Bank will consider a broad range of labour market 
indicators.2 The Bank will also systematically report to Canadians on 
how labour market outcomes have factored into its policy decisions.
Monitoring infl
 ation
 

In the short run, the prices of certain CPI components can be 
particularly volatile and can cause sizable fl
 uctuations in CPI infl
 ation.
 

In setting monetary policy, the Bank seeks to look through such 
transitory movements in CPI infl
 ation and focuses on a set of “core” 
infl
 ation measures that better refl
 ect the underlying trend of infl
 ation. 
In this sense, these measures act as an operational guide to help the 
Bank achieve the CPI infl
 ation target. They are not a replacement for 
CPI infl
 ation.
 

The Bank’s three preferred measures of core infl
 ation are CPI-trim, 
which excludes CPI components whose rates of change in a given 
month are the most extreme; CPI-median, which corresponds to 
the price change located at the 50th percentile (in terms of basket 
weight) of the distribution of price changes; and CPI-common, which 
uses a statistical procedure to track common price changes across 
categories in the CPI basket.

Overview
Overview
A robust economic recovery continued throughout the second half of 2021 
in Canada and abroad. Taking into account the faster-than-expected growth 
and strong job gains, the Bank judges that economic slack is now essentially 
absorbed.
The Omicron variant of COVID-19 emerged in late autumn, triggering 
household cautiousness and public health measures. These are temporarily 
slowing economic activity globally. The economic impacts of Omicron in 
Canada will likely be limited by high vaccination rates and the continuing 
adaptability of businesses and households (Box 1).   
Disruptions to global supply chains have broadened and become more 
pronounced, pushing inflation higher in most advanced and emerging-market 
economies (EMEs). In response to inflationary pressures, some central banks 
have already raised their policy interest rates, and others have signalled they 
plan to do so.
Key messages  
	
 The Canadian economy had strong momentum heading into 2022.  
	
 A wide range of measures and indicators suggest that economic slack is now 
absorbed. Estimates of the output gap are consistent with this evidence.
	
 Public health measures and widespread worker absences related to the 
Omicron variant are slowing economic activity in the first quarter of 2022, 
but the economic impact is expected to be less severe than previous 
waves. 
	
 With the virus and related supply disruptions expected to fade, consumer 
spending is anticipated to rebound and exports and business investment 
are projected to grow solidly. 
	
 The impacts from global and domestic supply disruptions are currently 
exerting upward pressure on prices. Inflationary pressures from strong 
demand, supply shortages and high energy prices should subside during 
the year. Inflation is expected to decline relatively quickly to about 3% by 
the end of 2022. 
	
 Over the medium term, increased productivity is expected to boost supply 
growth, and demand growth is projected to moderate. Inflation is expected 
to decline gradually through 2023 and 2024 to close to 2%. 
	
 The Bank views the risks around this inflation outlook as roughly balanced. 
However, with inflation above the top of the Bank’s inflation-control range 
and expected to stay there for some time, the upside risks are of greater 
concern.

BANK OF CANADA  •  Monetary Policy Report  •  January 2022
 
Box 1
Key inputs to the projection
The Bank of Canada’s projection is always conditional 
on several key assumptions, and changes to them will 
affect the outlook for the Canadian economy. The Bank 
regularly reviews these assumptions and assesses the 
sensitivity of the economic projection to them. The key 
inputs into the Bank’s projection are as follows:
 
 Vaccination rollouts are progressing in many regions 
around the world. It is assumed that most global public 
health restrictions and physical distancing measures 
will be lifted over the course of 2022. Some of these 
measures are expected to remain in place longer in 
emerging-market economies because of lower rates of 
vaccination.
 
 Most public health restrictions in Canada are expected 
to be eased in the fi
 rst quarter of 2022. Pandemic-
related effects on demand—notably, consumer caution 
and reluctance to travel—are assumed to diminish 
gradually over the projection horizon.
 
 As in the October projection, spending on household 
consumption is assumed to be boosted by an 
additional $40 billion as individuals draw down a 
portion of their extra savings accumulated during the 
pandemic.
 
 The projection incorporates information from all 
available provincial and federal budgets.
 
 Oil prices are assumed to remain near recent levels. 
The per-barrel prices in US dollars are assumed to be 
$80 for Brent, $75 for West Texas Intermediate and 
$65 for Western Canadian Select, as in the October 
Report.
 
 By convention, the Bank does not forecast the 
exchange rate in the Monetary Policy Report. The 
Canadian dollar is assumed to remain at 79 cents US 
over the projection horizon, close to its recent average 
and just below the 80 cents US assumed in the 
October Report.
 
 The pandemic is having both temporary and lasting 
effects on the supply side of the Canadian economy.1
 

The Bank’s assessment of the growth of potential 
output, a longer-term concept, looks through the 
short-lived effects of factors such as containment 
measures, supply chain disruptions and labour 
market mismatches. As in the October Report, 
potential output growth is assumed to average 
1 As in recent reports, the Bank distinguishes in the near term between supply 
and potential output to account for the relatively short-lived nature of some 
of the decrease in supply caused by public health measures, supply chain 
disruptions and labour market mismatches.
about 1.6% per year over 2021–23. However, the 
level of potential output is raised by 0.3% due to 
positive historical revisions to investment, capital 
stock and gross domestic product (GDP). Despite 
these revisions, the level of potential output at the 
end of 2023 is projected to remain about 0.8% 
below the pre-pandemic estimate.2
 

The projection assumes that several short-term 
factors are adversely affecting the supply of goods 
and services. First, supply chain disruptions are 
having a large, temporary impact on supply. Second, 
the mismatch between employers’ needs and 
unemployed workers’ skills—exacerbated by the 
unevenness of the pandemic shock—is contributing 
to the temporary rise in long-term unemployment. 
Together, these two effects are assumed to reduce 
supply, with a peak impact of 2.0% in the fourth 
quarter of 2021, slightly more severe than was 
estimated in October. These effects are anticipated 
to remain elevated in the fi
 rst half of 2022 and to 
dissipate over the rest of the year. Third, measures 
taken to contain the Omicron variant coupled with 
elevated worker absences due to the rise in cases 
are expected to decrease supply temporarily in the 
fi
 rst quarter of 2022 (see Chart 8 on page 16).
 

Estimates of overall supply growth can be obtained 
by combining the estimates of the temporary effects 
of these short-term factors with the assessment of 
potential output.
 
 GDP grew at a strong pace amid increased supply 
disruptions in the fourth quarter of 2021. The Bank 
estimates that the output gap—the difference between 
GDP and supply—was about -0.75% to 0.25% in the 
fourth quarter, smaller than the estimate of -2.25% to 
-1.25% for the previous quarter.
 
 The neutral nominal policy interest rate is defi
 ned as 
the real neutral rate plus 2% for infl
 ation. The neutral 
real rate is defi
 ned as the rate consistent with both 
output remaining sustainably at its potential and 
infl
 ation remaining at target, on an ongoing basis. 
It is a medium- to long-term equilibrium concept. 
For Canada, the economic projection is based on 
an assumption that the nominal neutral rate is at the 
midpoint of the estimated range of 1.75% to 2.75%. This 
range was last reassessed in the April 2021 Report.
2 Estimates of the level of potential output in 2023 were not constructed as part 
of the January 2020 projection. The pre-pandemic estimate referred to in 
the text is calculated by extending the January 2020 projection for potential 
output by two years, i.e., through 2023. It uses the estimate for potential 
growth in 2021 that was provided in the January 2020 Report.

Global economy
Global economy
Global economic activity recovered strongly in 2021. In the United States, 
the recovery has been robust, and the economy is now experiencing excess 
demand and particularly elevated inflation. Other regions have also made 
important progress, although most are still operating somewhat below 
capacity.
Inflation has risen around the world and is projected to peak by the first 
quarter of 2022 in most regions. High energy and food prices, as well 
as strong demand for goods amid widespread supply shortages and 
bottlenecks, have driven inflation up. Supply shortages are expected to 
dissipate gradually by the end of 2022. However, significant uncertainties 
remain about the resolution of these shortages, and the Omicron variant may 
lead to more disruptions in the near term.
The recovery is expected to continue over the projection horizon, despite 
some near-term weakness because of the emergence of the Omicron variant. 
Global growth is projected to moderate from 6¾% in 2021 to about 3½% in 
2022 and 2023 (Table 1). The US economy is expected to continue growing 
at a robust pace, albeit with some moderation as policy support eases. 
Growth in China is expected to be restrained by weakness in the property 
sector and strict COVID-19 policies. Overall, the global growth outlook is 
weaker than it was in the October Report (Box 2).

BANK OF CANADA  •  Monetary Policy Report  •  January 2022
Some tightening of global financial conditions 
Government bond yields have risen in recent months in many countries, 
including Canada and the United States. This partly reflects market 
participants’ anticipation that policy interest rates will be raised earlier than 
previously expected. Despite this recent tightening, financial conditions 
remain broadly accommodative. Corporate bond spreads and the 
Can$/US$ exchange rate are close to their levels at the time of the October 
Report. However, global equity prices have recently declined owing to the 
combination of higher expected interest rates and increased geopolitical 
tensions. 
Recent strong growth to moderate in the United States 
Gross domestic product (GDP) growth rebounded at the end of 2021 after a 
period of soft activity associated with the spread of the Delta variant at the 
end of the summer. The labour market tightened considerably in the fourth 
quarter, as demonstrated by the decline in the unemployment rate and the 
Box 2
Changes to the economic projection since the October Report
Global GDP outlook
Growth in China and emerging-market economies 
(EMEs) was a positive surprise for 2021. However, 
downward revisions to the outlook in most major regions 
over the projection horizon more than offset this growth. 
Overall, the level of global gross domestic product 
(GDP) has been revised down by 0.3% at the end of 
2023 relative to the October Report. The following 
factors explain the revisions to the outlook: 
 
 In response to the emergence of the Omicron 
variant of COVID-19, travel and public health 
restrictions are tighter than anticipated in all regions 
in early 2022. However, a large part of these effects 
should be temporary, and they are expected to 
dissipate in the second half of 2022 and in 2023.
 
 China’s outlook has been revised down, refl
 ecting a 
greater negative impact from the ongoing correction 
in the property sector.
 
 Monetary policy in the United States is expected to 
be less accommodative than previously anticipated 
because of the need to respond to higher-than-
expected infl
 ation.
Canadian GDP outlook
The level of GDP in Canada at the end of 2021 has 
been revised up due to stronger estimated growth in the 
fourth quarter. This improved forecast offsets historical 
data revisions that revealed a sharper contraction in the 
second quarter. Taken together, these revisions resulted 
in a lower estimate of GDP growth in 2021 by half a 
percentage point, to about 4½%.
GDP growth has been revised down by about a quarter 
of a percentage point in both 2022 and 2023, leaving the 
level of real GDP roughly ½
  % lower at the end of 2023. 
The following factors explain the revisions to the outlook:
 
 The Omicron variant and related containment 
measures temporarily reduce economic activity in 
the fi
 rst quarter of 2022. 
 
 Recent data and fi
 scal updates from provincial 
and federal governments suggest that growth 
in government spending is easing earlier than 
expected.
 
 Supply constraints will have larger and more broad-
based negative implications on economic activity 
over 2022.
 
 The growth profi
 les for exports and business 
investment are revised down. This is due in part 
to the downward revision to the projection of US 
growth.

 ation is expected to be 
higher than projected in October. The outlook for CPI 
infl
 ation in 2022 is revised up by about three-quarters of 
a percentage point to 4.2% and remains unchanged in 
2023 at 2.3%. This upward revision mainly refl
 ects 
larger impacts from various supply issues, notably those 
affecting shelter costs and food prices.

elevated number of job vacancies. Aggregate measures of wage growth have 
increased, particularly in industries that reopened quickly, such as leisure 
and hospitality.  
Bottlenecks at ports and global shortages of various goods will likely continue 
to curb production and push prices up. However, shipping costs seem to have 
plateaued, and some progress has been made on alleviating congestion at 
ports (Chart 1). Supply disruptions are anticipated to decline over 2022.
US GDP growth is projected to moderate from 5½% in 2021 to about 3¾% 
in 2022 and 2½% in 2023, as policy stimulus is withdrawn. Consumption is 
anticipated to remain solid in 2022 and 2023, supported by a strong labour 
market and households spending some of the savings they accumulated 
during the pandemic. The projection also incorporates the Bipartisan 
Infrastructure Law and other spending on research and development totalling 
US$1.5 trillion over eight years starting in 2022. 
Total and core measures of US personal consumption expenditures 
(PCE) inflation remain high and are expected to peak at 5.7% and 5.0%, 
respectively, in the first quarter of 2022.1 Past increases in energy prices 
and continued supply bottlenecks amid high demand for goods have been 
important contributors to inflationary pressures (Chart 2). The effects of 
energy and supply shortages are anticipated to decline, gradually leading 
to a moderation in inflation over the course of the year. However, with 
the economy expected to remain in excess demand, PCE inflation is 
anticipated to stay above 2% over the projection horizon, reaching 2.4% 
at the end of 2023.

Euro area recovery to continue amid new restrictions
Growth in the euro area is estimated to have slowed in late 2021, following 
the reintroduction of targeted restrictions in many countries in response to 
rising COVID-19 cases. The new wave of health and travel restrictions will 
likely be short-lived and the recovery is expected to continue, with growth 
gradually moderating in 2022 and 2023. 
Euro area inflation, as measured by the Harmonised Index of Consumer 
Prices (HICP), reached 5% in December. Most components of HICP have 
risen over the past year. However, a large part of the increase in inflation 
reflects high energy prices and past changes to the German value-added 
tax. Inflation is expected to ease over the projection horizon as the effects of 
these two factors dissipate.2 
Property sector weakness weighs on Chinese growth 
Growth in China is expected to slow to only 3¾% in 2022 as the property 
sector continues to adjust. Strict containment measures—particularly in 
light of the Omicron variant—continue to be a drag on the economy. Past 
tightening of regulations in the property sector has prompted a decline in 
housing activity that will likely be an important drag on growth in 2022. As a 
result, some property developers are experiencing financial distress. Other 
regulatory changes in a wide range of sectors, including technology and 
education, are also projected to weigh on domestic demand. 
In response to the economic slowdown, Chinese authorities have modestly 
increased policy support. Growth is projected to recover to about 5¼% in 
2023 as the drag on growth from the property sector diminishes. Uncertainty 
about both the impact of China’s “zero-COVID” policy and the fragility of the 
property sector remains high. Either of these factors could dampen growth by 
more than expected over the projection horizon.
2	 Energy prices in the euro area could continue to rise in the near term due to geopolitical tensions.

Lower vaccination rates and policy tightening in 
emerging-market economies 
After a strong recovery in 2021, growth is expected to slow in 2022 and 2023 
in oil-importing EMEs and in the rest-of-the world group. Many countries have 
tightened monetary policy in response to increased inflationary pressures. 
Higher interest rates will weigh on economic activity, particularly in Latin 
America, Russia and emerging Europe. Growth in some EMEs may also 
be affected by low vaccination rates and renewed measures to contain 
COVID-19 outbreaks.
High and volatile commodity prices 
Oil prices have experienced significant volatility since the October Report 
(Chart 3). They initially fell sharply as the emergence of the Omicron 
variant increased uncertainty. With the economic impacts of Omicron now 
looking less severe than initially feared, prices have recovered. Concerns 
about global energy supply and heightened geopolitical tensions have also 
contributed to the rebound in oil prices. Over the projection horizon, the 
per-barrel prices of Brent, West Texas Intermediate and Western Canadian 
Select oil are assumed to be US$80, US$75 and US$65, respectively, the 
same levels as in the October Report (Box 1). 
Prices could stay above the flat oil price assumption if global energy 
shortages were to continue. Oil prices could also fall below this assumption if 
members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) 
and some non-OPEC oil producers, including the United States, were 
to significantly increase production. The severity and persistence of the 
Omicron variant also remains a downside risk.

Lumber prices have surged since the October Report, largely reflecting the 
combination of strong demand from the North American housing sector and 
floods in British Columbia that have hindered rail and road transportation. 
Prices of base metals and agricultural products are marginally stronger than 
in October. Markets expect these non-energy commodity prices to stay 
elevated over the projection horizon. This is because of reduced supply—
notably due to high energy input costs—and strong global demand.

Canadian economy
Canadian economy
The Canadian economy experienced a strong rebound through the second 
half of 2021. Economic growth surged as the easing of public health 
measures boosted consumption of services, and exports bounced back due 
to growing foreign demand.  
The unexpected arrival of the highly infectious Omicron variant is causing 
renewed hardship for many. It also serves as a reminder that the evolution 
of the pandemic remains uncertain. The sharp increase in the number of 
cases and the imposition of related public health measures are slowing 
activity at the start of 2022, but robust growth should resume in the second 
quarter. The combination of high vaccination rates and improved adaptability 
of businesses and consumers limits the downside economic risks from this 
wave of the pandemic. 
Labour conditions are strong. The labour market had recovered to pre-
pandemic levels by the end of 2021. The employment rate has fully recovered 
when accounting for demographic change, firms are having difficulty finding 
workers, and wage growth is rising. Omicron is leading to some temporary 
job losses in hard-to-distance sectors and to a spike in worker absences 
more broadly, but these effects are expected to be short-lived. 
Faced with robust demand, many Canadian businesses are experiencing 
challenges due to supply constraints. Transportation bottlenecks, labour 
shortages and difficulty sourcing key inputs are resulting in reduced hours of 
operation, production slowdowns and delayed or cancelled sales. The overall 
effects of these supply disruptions are estimated to have been larger, broader 
and more persistent than initially anticipated. Exports and business investment 
have been particularly affected, as has consumer spending on some durable 
goods such as motor vehicles.   
The outlook is for strong growth over the projection horizon as demand 
remains robust and supply recovers from the effects of the pandemic, with 
disruptions expected to ease gradually through 2022. Overall, growth is 
forecast to be around 4% in 2022 and 3.5% in 2023, supported by household 
spending on services, exports and investment (Table 2). This growth forecast 
is slightly weaker than in the October Report (Box 2). 
Consumer price index (CPI) inflation is forecast to remain close to 5% over 
the first half of 2022. This is due to supply constraints coinciding with high 
energy prices and rising food costs. CPI inflation is anticipated to ease to 
about 3% by the end of 2022 as these pressures dissipate. Inflation is then 
expected to decline to around 2¼% by the second half of 2023 and remain 
close to the target in 2024.

Strong momentum heading into 2022 
Growth was robust in the second half of 2021, at around 5½%. It is expected 
to moderate to about 2% in the first quarter (Table 3 and Chart 4). The 
Omicron variant and its related supply disruptions are expected to temporarily 
weigh on hard-to-distance services such as travel and indoor dining, with the 
effects mitigated by governments extending their support programs. Elevated 
worker absences due to the rise in cases are anticipated to temporarily affect 
a broader range of industries. Strong growth is expected to resume later in 
the first quarter.

Housing market activity has strengthened again in recent months, led by 
a rebound in resales (Chart 5).3 Low borrowing rates and high disposable 
incomes are continuing to contribute to elevated levels of housing activity in 
the first quarter. At the same time, other factors that support demand, such 
as population growth, are also now picking up.

Supply constraints continue to weigh on spending and production. This 
can be seen, for example, in delays in the delivery of key inputs used by 
manufacturers (Chart 6). Despite these near-term challenges, solid foreign 
demand and improving business confidence should continue to support 
robust growth in business investment and exports. 
Labour markets tightened   
Employment growth has been robust in recent months. The unemployment 
rate is only 0.3 percentage points higher than it was in February 2020. 
Labour force participation rates are at or above pre-pandemic levels for most 
age groups, and job postings are at near-record levels. The Omicron wave 
is weighing temporarily on employment in hard-to-distance sectors. The 
expected short duration of restrictions should limit the impact on the labour 
market.
In the Bank’s Business Outlook Survey (BOS) for the fourth quarter of 2021, 
about 40% of firms reported that labour shortages are restricting their ability 
to meet demand—a level not seen since 2007. Moreover, most of these firms 
expect the shortages to persist until at least 2023.
Wage growth is picking up, partly due to the need to attract employees 
(Chart 7). Given a greater number of job openings, many workers can more 
easily find higher-paying jobs that better fit their skills, and this should boost 
productivity.

Labour productivity growth has been weak amid broader labour market gains. 
Supply shortages, restrictions on the number of customers being served and 
slack in hard-to-distance services, such as travel, are likely contributing to 
this weakness. As pandemic-related supply disruptions abate and business 
investment strengthens, labour productivity growth should increase.  
Economic slack absorbed
The absorption of economic slack in the second half of 2021 was faster than 
expected in the October Report. At that time, output and employment growth 
were projected to be strong, but the recovery has been even more robust. 
This is due to a surge in services consumption, strong growth in exports 
and the addition of almost 800,000 jobs since May. At the same time, supply 
has been revised down since October because of further bottlenecks and 
shortages related to the pandemic (Chart 8 and Box 1). Businesses have 
also reported that they increasingly face capacity constraints as they try to 
meet elevated demand. 
Consequently, a broad set of measures—including labour market indicators, 
surveys on business sentiment and measures of core inflation—suggest that 
economic slack is now absorbed (Box 3). Taking the respective demand 
and supply pressures into account, the Bank estimates that the output gap 
narrowed to between -0.75% and 0.25% in the fourth quarter of 2021.

the estimated common trend of annual growth for wages based on employees’ job status (full or part time), job permanency (permanent or temporary), industry of 
employment and occupation. The national accounts wage measure is constructed as total wages and salaries at a monthly frequency from the Canadian System of 
Macroeconomic Accounts divided by total hours worked from SEPH.

Economic slack in the fourth quarter of 2021
Estimates of the degree of slack in the overall economy 
are inherently uncertain. This is particularly true 
given the signifi
 cant and unprecedented disruptions 
to supply and demand brought on by the pandemic. 
Consequently, a wide range of measures and indicators 
should be considered when estimating slack. These 
include the state of the labour market, responses to 
surveys on business sentiment, measures of core 
infl
 ation and estimates of the economy-wide output gap.

Box 3 (continued)
such as the employment, participation and unemployment 
rates are close to their pre-pandemic levels.1 The job 
vacancy rate is near a series high, suggesting that labour 
market conditions are tight. Measures of inclusiveness 
have also improved with the return of employment 
rates to pre-pandemic levels for youth, as well as for 
women after accounting for changes in the population. 
In addition, respondents to the Business Outlook Survey 
report that labour shortages are at their highest level in 
more than a decade.
Some segments of the labour market have yet to fully 
recover: 
 
 Employment of workers in low-wage occupations 
has continued to lag. 
 
 The proportion of long-term unemployment remains 
high. 
 
 Some measures of year-over-year wage growth 
have not quite fully rebounded.  
Business capacity pressures
Canadian businesses across a wide range of sectors 
report that they are facing capacity constraints. The 
fourth-quarter 2021 Business Outlook Survey shows that 
more than three-quarters of respondents would have 
diffi
 culty meeting an unexpected increase in demand—a 
survey high (Chart 3-B). In many cases, labour 
shortages are contributing to these capacity constraints. 
Private sector surveys show similar results. While survey 
respondents continue to point to supply disruptions as 
playing an important role, many businesses also cite 
strong demand. Capacity pressures are being reported 
not only by businesses that have seen their revenues 
grow over the course of the pandemic but also by those 
that have not.  
Measures of core infl
 ation 
Rates of core infl
 ation also suggest that economic slack 
is absorbed. In normal circumstances, core infl
 ation 
staying persistently at 2% would be consistent with no 
economic slack. The Bank’s three preferred measures 
of core infl
 ation—CPI-common, CPI-median and CPI-
trim—currently sit at 2.1%, 3.0% and 3.7%, respectively. 
The price distortions caused by the pandemic make 
it more diffi
 cult to use measures of core infl
 ation as a 
proxy for slack. For example, the impact of supply chain 
disruptions abroad may be pushing up CPI-trim and 
CPI-median; as a result, there may appear to be more 
excess demand in the domestic economy than there 
1 The labour market at the end of 2019 can be characterized as having had no 
slack.
actually is. CPI-common, which puts more weight on 
services and consequently on domestic conditions, has 
also been affected. Nevertheless, all three measures 
have moved up over the past year to above 2%, 
suggesting that the economy is at full capacity. 
Output gap
Estimates of the output gap bring together the Bank’s 
assessment of both labour market slack and how labour 
productivity differs from its trend. While labour market slack 
is absorbed, supply disruptions and pandemic-related 
restrictions have weighed on labour productivity. Moreover, 
investment has been weak since the beginning of 2020.
The Bank takes these factors, as well as the latest 
upward revision to quarterly growth at the end of 2021, 
into account when estimating the output gap. The Bank 
estimates the output gap—the difference between gross 
domestic product and supply—to be between -0.75% 
and 0.25% in the fourth quarter of 2021. It is important to 
note that the complexity of recovery makes estimates of 
the output gap more uncertain than normal.
Assessment of economic slack
The job market is tight, businesses face historically high 
capacity constraints, and measures of core infl
 ation are 
above 2%. The Bank’s estimate of the economy-wide 
output gap is consistent with these indicators. Taken 
together, these factors support the Bank’s assessment 
that, overall, slack is absorbed in Canada.

CPI inflation elevated  
CPI inflation is forecast to average close to 5% in the first half of 2022. 
Inflation is elevated because of higher prices for durable goods, energy and 
food (Chart 9).

Durable goods prices are being pushed up by global supply chain 
disruptions, while Canadian energy prices are higher because of elevated 
global oil and natural gas prices. At the same time, last year’s drought and 
ongoing supply challenges are contributing to higher food prices (Box 4). The 
result is that goods price inflation has reached nearly 7%, well above the 
previous 10-year average of roughly 1% (Chart 10). Taken together, energy 
prices and components subject to supply constraints are currently adding 
nearly 4 percentage points to inflation. 
Box 4
Upward pressure on food prices to persist
As consumers face rising prices at grocery stores, 
food price infl
 ation is making headlines. Prices for food 
purchased in stores are up nearly 6% year over year 
(Chart 4-A).
Food categories with the strongest price infl
 ation 
include:1
 
 beef, bacon and chicken—up 12%, 19% and 6%, 
respectively 
 
 breakfast cereals, prepared fruits and prepared 
vegetables—up about 6%
 
 potato chips and other snacks and margarine—up 
about 7% and 18%, respectively
Several factors contribute to this recent increase in food 
prices. 
First, domestic prices for agricultural commodities, 
which closely follow global prices, have recently 
increased signifi
 cantly (Chart 4-B). This is due to 
unfavourable weather conditions in many growing areas 
of the world, including the drought in Western Canada. 
Because producing livestock and many processed foods 
requires these agricultural commodities, the higher input 
costs are passed along to consumers.
Second, supply chain disruptions have adversely 
affected food processors’ productivity and unit costs. In 
addition, food processors have slowed production lines 
to implement health measures to protect their workers. 
Third, higher energy costs are putting upward pressure 
on distribution costs. These and other such cost 
increases are contributing to, for example, the recent 
administrative increase in milk prices paid to farmers. 
These increases in food prices will likely continue. As 
a result, the Bank of Canada expects that food price 
infl
 ation will be above its historical average over 2022.
1 These food categories are either shown or included in a grouping in 
Chart 4-A.

Services price inflation, which is affected by both domestic and external 
forces, has risen to nearly 3.5%. The increase is led by escalating 
construction costs due to higher prices for building materials and labour 
shortages. As a result of these factors, price pressures have broadened 
across CPI components (Chart 10). Close to 55% of CPI components are 
now growing at more than 3%, well above the historical average of 30%.   
Core measures of inflation have edged higher since October, with CPI-trim 
and CPI-median at 3.7% and 3.0%, respectively (Chart 11). CPI-common 
has remained more muted at 2.1% because it attaches less importance to 
some components that have seen the largest price changes, such as motor 
vehicles. In contrast, some components with high weights—such as local 
transportation and health care goods—have experienced less intense price 
pressures.

BANK OF CANADA  •  Monetary Policy Report  •  January 2022
Strong growth over the projection horizon 
Economic growth is projected to be robust and more balanced, averaging 
3¾% over 2022 and 2023, supported by strong domestic and foreign 
demand (Table 2). As supply shortages ease and COVID-19 restrictions are 
removed, GDP will grow faster than employment, and output per worker will 
rise. Together with robust business investment and higher immigration, this 
increase in labour productivity will increase supply growth and should support 
economic growth without putting additional pressure on inflation. 
Consumption-led recovery
Consumption growth is forecast to be strong over the projection horizon, 
supported by job gains (Chart 12). Consumption should also be boosted by 
improving confidence and some spending of accumulated savings. 
Beyond the first quarter of 2022, spending on hard-to-distance services is 
expected to increase further as cautiousness around the pandemic fades. 
Purchases that have been delayed—for goods such as motor vehicles and 
appliances—will also increase as supply disruptions ease. 
Housing market activity is anticipated to remain elevated but ease from its 
current levels. Resales should be dampened by the fading of the pandemic-
induced boost in demand, reduced support from accumulated savings, and 
borrowing rates that are now above their pandemic lows. Meanwhile, the 
easing of supply chain disruptions should support residential construction 
over 2022. The resulting growth in supply combined with easing demand 
should help rebalance housing markets and contribute to a moderation in 
house price growth.

Foreign demand to support solid export growth
Export growth is projected to be robust in 2022, boosted by solid foreign 
demand and elevated commodity prices (Chart 13). It then moderates, 
along with US growth, in 2023. Goods exports, excluding energy, will also be 
supported by the dissipation of global supply disruptions. 
Services exports are anticipated to strengthen as international travel 
recovers. The recovery is expected to take time given the slow return of 
international tourism. Over the long term, the overall level of international 
travel may also be negatively affected by new ways of working and efforts to 
address climate change. 
Relatively high prices for oil and natural gas are projected to support energy 
exports. Growth in energy exports is expected to be strong in 2022. It then 
eases in 2023 as expansions of oil sands production slow. With the addition 
of the Trans Mountain Expansion, transportation capacity should be sufficient 
to accommodate rising oil exports for several years.
As supply chain issues ease, strong domestic demand and firms’ desire to 
invest and rebuild inventories should support the recovery in goods imports.
Business investment to strengthen
Robust business investment is expected after a period of pandemic-related 
weakness (Chart 14). Outside the oil and gas sector, firms are expected 
to increase their investment in the face of growing domestic and foreign 
demand, improved business confidence, limited production capacity and the 
gradual easing of supply constraints. The BOS for the fourth quarter of 2021 
revealed broad-based strength in investment intentions.
Investment in the oil and gas sector is anticipated to increase but remain 
below pre-pandemic levels. Despite relatively elevated price levels, long-term 
investments, such as those in the oil sands, will likely remain subdued given 
high uncertainty about future demand. In contrast, shorter-term investments, 
such as conventional oil and gas wells, are expected to rise.

Inventory investment is projected to contribute to growth as businesses 
rebuild their inventories following unprecedented drawdowns in 2020 and 
ongoing delivery delays.
CPI inflation to decline in the second half of this year
As pandemic-related forces fade, inflation is forecast to ease over the second 
half of 2022 and into early 2023 (Chart 15). Upward pressure from supply 
shortages is expected to diminish over 2022. Under the assumption that oil 
prices remain flat, the boost from higher gasoline prices should also fade in 
the coming quarters. This expected easing can be seen in the evolution of 
annualized quarter-over-quarter inflation rates, which fall from around 4¾% 
in the first quarter of 2022 to about 2¼% by the fourth quarter of 2022. Year-
over-year inflation is projected to decline from about 5% in early 2022 to 
about 3% by the end of 2022 as these pressures dissipate. Inflation is then 
expected to decline to around 2¼% by the second half of 2023 and remain 
close to the target in 2024.
Businesses and consumers view price pressures as elevated over the next 
two years. Most respondents to both the BOS and the Canadian Survey of 
Consumer Expectations for the fourth quarter of 2021 anticipate inflation to 
be above 3% on average over the next two years. 
Despite this rise in expected inflation, longer-term inflation expectations remain 
well anchored (Chart 16). Most firms that responded to the recent BOS expect 
inflation to return close to the 2% target in one to three years. 
Private sector forecasters have increased their expectations for inflation over 
the next year, but their longer-term expectations have remained stable. The 
October 2021 Consensus Economics forecast continues to show an average 
of 2% over the next 10 years. In addition, while the 5- and 10-year Canadian 
break-even inflation rates are now somewhat above pre-pandemic levels, 
they are well aligned with the 2% inflation target.

Canada’s balance sheet
Canada’s balance sheet
In November 2021, in light of the progress made in the economic recovery, 
the Bank ended its program of quantitative easing (QE) and entered the 
reinvestment phase. In this phase, the Bank purchases Government of 
Canada bonds solely to replace maturing bonds and maintain the stimulus 
provided by previous QE purchases. At present, this requires approximately 
$4 billion to $5 billion in purchases per month (or about $1 billion per week) 
across both the primary and secondary markets (Chart 17). These purchases 
keep the Bank’s holdings of Government of Canada bonds roughly constant 
at around $435 billion. This amount currently represents 87% of the Bank’s 
total assets. The rest of the balance sheet largely reflects assets acquired 
early in the pandemic to keep markets functioning. Most of the assets 
acquired then have already matured and rolled off the Bank’s balance sheet, 
and the remainder will do so over time.

Risks to the inflation outlook
Risks to the inflation outlook
Uncertainty around the projection remains unusually high. The outlook 
continues to depend on how the COVID-19 pandemic evolves, most notably 
the spread of variants. The pandemic will continue to weigh on confidence 
and disrupt supply for some time, posing both upward and downward risks to 
inflation. While high vaccination rates in Canada have diminished the likelihood 
of a severe downturn, the reopening of the economy remains complex. 
Pervasive supply constraints will need to unwind. Moreover, the work routines 
and spending habits of households are shifting. Consequently, the evolution of 
supply and demand and its effects on inflation are particularly uncertain.
Some of the risks identified in previous reports have been partially 
incorporated into the projection. For example, the base-case scenario 
includes a short-lived negative impact from the Omicron variant as well as 
more widespread inflationary pressures from supply-side disruptions.
While the upside and downside risks to the Bank’s inflation projection are 
viewed as roughly balanced, the upside risks are of greater concern. Until 
inflation moves significantly lower, there is an elevated risk that Canadians 
will start to believe that inflation will stay high over the long term. Higher 
inflation expectations could in turn lead to more pervasive labour costs and 
inflationary pressures and could become embedded in ongoing inflation.
Drawing from a larger set of risks, this section presents a selection of those 
identified as most important for the projected path of inflation.
(i)	
More persistent effects of the pandemic on confidence (↓)
The emergence of the Omicron variant is a reminder that the evolution 
of the pandemic remains uncertain. The pandemic’s effects on 
business sentiment, household confidence and economic activity may 
be more severe and persistent than assumed in the projection. For 
instance, COVID-19 variants could induce a longer-lasting drag on 
confidence and delay the recovery in hard-to-distance service sectors.
(ii)	
More persistent supply bottlenecks and cost pressures (↑)
The spread of COVID-19 variants could further disrupt manufacturing and 
shipping activities, causing longer-lasting shortages of goods and labour. 
It could also delay the rebalancing of consumption from goods to services. 
A continued preference for goods consumption would exacerbate 
congestion in already stretched supply chains. Moreover, repeated 
disruptions to business operations may lead firms to adjust their supply 
chains in ways that could increase costs. More persistent labour shortages 
could also result in greater wage pressures. Taken together, these effects 
would lead to more persistent inflationary pressures.

(iii)	 Reversal of growth in goods prices (↓)
Pandemic-induced shifts in consumption patterns and disruptions in 
supply have pushed prices of goods higher. The base-case scenario 
assumes that these price increases faced by consumers do not 
reverse. However, the rebalancing of consumption from goods to 
services could occur faster than assumed in the projection. Combined 
with an expansion of transportation capacity and efforts to improve 
logistics, these developments could resolve supply chain disruptions 
faster than expected and cause some prices to decline. If this 
occurred, inflation would be weaker than projected. For example, in a 
scenario with a 30% reversal of these pandemic-induced effects on 
prices, inflation falls more quickly, declining to slightly below 2% in 
2023.
(iv)	 Stronger household spending in Canada (↑)
The projection continues to include some degree of caution around 
consumption. However, over time, a reduction in pandemic-related 
uncertainty could boost confidence by more than expected. 
Consequently, households could spend more of their accumulated 
savings. Consumption and residential investment would then be 
stronger than projected and would contribute to greater inflationary 
pressures.
(v)	
Sharp deterioration of global economic and financial 
conditions (↓)
With high levels of global indebtedness and elevated equity valuations, 
a pullback in risk appetite could trigger a sharp tightening of global 
financial conditions. Increased inflationary pressures and the 
associated uncertainty surrounding how soon advanced economies 
will reduce monetary policy stimulus could trigger capital outflows, 
especially from some EMEs. Such outflows would create financial 
stress, leading to slower growth. In addition, efforts by Chinese 
authorities to address vulnerabilities and engineer a soft landing in the 
property sector could weigh on growth more than expected. These 
shocks could have negative spillover effects on the global economy 
and would be transmitted to the Canadian economy through weaker 
exports, lower commodity prices and a deterioration in the terms of 
trade.
