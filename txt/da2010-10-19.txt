The Bank of Canada today announced that it is maintaining its target for the
overnight rate at 1 per cent. The Bank Rate is correspondingly 1 1/4 per cent and
the deposit rate is 3/4 per cent.
The global economic recovery is entering a new phase. In advanced economies,
temporary factors supporting growth in 2010 - such as the inventory cycle and
pent-up demand - have largely run their course and fiscal stimulus will shift to
fiscal consolidation over the projection horizon. While the Bank expects that
private demand in advanced economies will become sufficiently entrenched to
sustain the recovery, the combination of difficult labour market dynamics and
ongoing deleveraging in many advanced economies is expected to moderate the
pace of growth relative to prior expectations. These factors will contribute to a
weaker-than-projected recovery in the United States in particular. Growth in
emerging-market economies is expected to ease to a more sustainable pace as
fiscal and monetary policies are tightened. Heightened tensions in currency
markets and related risks associated with global imbalances could result in a
more protracted and difficult global recovery.
The economic outlook for Canada has changed. The Bank expects the economic
recovery to be more gradual than it had projected in its July Monetary Policy
Report, with growth of 3.0 per cent in 2010, 2.3 per cent in 2011, and 2.6 per cent
in 2012. This more modest growth profile reflects a more gradual global recovery
and a more subdued profile for household spending. With housing activity
declining markedly as anticipated and household debt considerations becoming
more important, the Bank expects household expenditures to decelerate to a
pace closer to the rate of income growth over the projection horizon. Overall, the
composition of demand in Canada is expected to shift away from government and
household expenditures towards business investment and net exports. The
strength of net exports will be sensitive to currency movements, the expected
recovery in productivity growth, and the prospects for external demand.

Inflation in Canada has been slightly below the Bankâ€™s July projection. The recent
moderation in core inflation is consistent with the persistence of significant excess
supply and a deceleration in the growth of unit labour costs. The Bank judges that
the output gap is slightly larger and that the economy will return to full capacity
by the end of 2012 rather than the beginning of that year, as had been anticipated
in July. The inflation outlook has been revised down and both total CPI and core
inflation are now expected to converge to 2 per cent by the end of 2012, as excess
supply in the economy is gradually absorbed and inflation expectations remain
well-anchored.
Reflecting all of these factors, the Bank has decided to maintain the target for the
overnight rate at 1 per cent. This leaves considerable monetary stimulus in place,
consistent with achieving the 2 per cent inflation target in an environment of
significant excess supply in Canada.
At this time of transition in the global recovery, with a weaker U.S. outlook,
constraints beginning to moderate growth in emerging-market economies, and
domestic considerations that are expected to slow consumption and housing
activity in Canada, any further reduction in monetary policy stimulus would need
to be carefully considered.
