Canada’s infl
 ation-control strategy
Canada’s infl
 ation-control strategy
Infl
 ation targeting and the economy
 

The objective of Canada’s monetary policy is to promote the 
economic and fi
 nancial well-being of Canadians. Canada’s 
experience with infl
 ation targeting since 1991 has shown that the 
best way that monetary policy can achieve this goal is by maintaining 
a low and stable infl
 ation environment. Doing so fosters confi
 dence 
in the value of money and contributes to sustained economic growth, 
a strong and inclusive labour market and improved living standards.
 

In 2021, the Government of Canada and the Bank of Canada 
renewed the fl
 exible infl
 ation-targeting strategy of the monetary policy 
framework for a further fi
 ve-year period, ending December 31, 2026.1 
 

The infl
 ation target was renewed at the 2% midpoint of the 1%–3% 
control range, with infl
 ation measured as the 12-month rate of 
change in the consumer price index (CPI). 
 

The Government and the Bank agreed that the best contribution 
monetary policy can make to the economic and fi
 nancial 
well-being of Canadians is to continue to focus on price stability. 
The Government and the Bank also agreed that monetary policy 
should continue to support maximum sustainable employment, 
recognizing that maximum sustainable employment is not directly 
measurable and is determined largely by non-monetary factors 
that can change through time. 
 

Further, the Government and the Bank agreed that because well-
anchored infl
 ation expectations are critical to achieving both price 
stability and maximum sustainable employment, the primary objective 
of monetary policy is to maintain low, stable infl
 ation over time. 
Infl
 ation targeting is symmetric and ﬂ
 exible
 

Canada’s infl
 ation-targeting approach is symmetric, which means 
the Bank is equally concerned about infl
 ation rising above or falling 
below the 2% target. 
 

Canada’s infl
 ation-targeting approach is also ﬂ
 exible. Typically, 
the Bank seeks to return infl
 ation to target over a horizon of six to 
eight quarters. However, the most appropriate horizon for returning 
infl
 ation to target will vary depending on the nature and persistence 
of the shocks buffeting the economy.
 

The 2021 agreement with the Government specifi
 es that the 2% 
infl
 ation target remains the cornerstone of the framework. 
 

The agreement further notes that the Bank will continue to use the 
fl
 exibility of the 1%–3% control range to actively seek the maximum 
sustainable level of employment, when conditions warrant. The Bank 
will also continue to leverage the fl
 exibility inherent in the framework 
to help address the challenges of structurally low interest rates by 
using a broad set of policy tools. The Bank will use this fl
 exibility only 
to an extent that is consistent with keeping medium-term infl
 ation 
expectations well anchored at 2%.
Monetary policy tools
 

Because monetary policy actions take time to work their way through 
the economy and have their full effect on infl
 ation, monetary policy 
must be forward-looking.
 

The Bank normally carries out monetary policy through changes 
in the target for the overnight rate of interest (the policy rate). The 
Bank also has a range of monetary policy tools it can use when the 
policy rate is at very low levels. These tools consist of guidance on 
the future evolution of the policy rate, large-scale asset purchases 
(quantitative easing and credit easing), funding for credit measures, 
and negative policy rates. The potential use and sequencing of these 
tools would depend on the economic and fi
 nancial market context.
 

All of the Bank’s monetary policy tools affect total demand for 
Canadian goods and services through their infl
 uence on market 
interest rates, domestic asset prices and the exchange rate. The 
balance between this demand and the economy’s production 
capacity is, over time, the main factor that determines infl
 ation 
pressures in the economy.
Communications
 

Consistent with its commitment to clear, transparent communications, 
the Bank regularly reports its perspectives on the economy and 
infl
 ation. Policy decisions are typically announced on eight pre-set 
days during the year, and full updates of the Bank’s outlook are 
published four times each year in the Monetary Policy Report.
 

The Bank is committed to explaining when it is using the fl
 exibility of 
the infl
 ation-targeting strategy.
 

Given the uncertainty about the maximum sustainable level of 
employment, the Bank will consider a broad range of labour market 
indicators.2 The Bank will also systematically report to Canadians on 
how labour market outcomes have factored into its policy decisions.
Monitoring infl
 ation
 

In the short run, the prices of certain CPI components can be 
particularly volatile and can cause sizable fl
 uctuations in CPI infl
 ation.
 

In setting monetary policy, the Bank seeks to look through such 
transitory movements in CPI infl
 ation and focuses on a set of “core” 
infl
 ation measures that better refl
 ect the underlying trend of infl
 ation. 
In this sense, these measures act as an operational guide to help the 
Bank achieve the CPI infl
 ation target. They are not a replacement for 
CPI infl
 ation.
 

The Bank’s three preferred measures of core infl
 ation are CPI-trim, 
which excludes CPI components whose rates of change in a given 
month are the most extreme; CPI-median, which corresponds to 
the price change located at the 50th percentile (in terms of basket 
weight) of the distribution of price changes; and CPI-common, which 
uses a statistical procedure to track common price changes across 
categories in the CPI basket.

Overview
Overview
Inflation around the world remains high and broad-based, despite falling 
commodity prices and evidence that supply challenges are gradually easing.
In response, many central banks have been rapidly increasing their policy rates. 
Global growth is slowing sharply due to the associated tightening in financial 
conditions worldwide, as well as the acute energy shortages and ongoing 
uncertainty because of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Financial stresses have 
increased.
The Bank of Canada has been raising its policy interest rate to slow demand 
growth, anchor inflation expectations and bring inflation down. Slower domestic 
and foreign demand, lower commodity prices and the fading impact of global 
supply disruptions will reduce price pressures over the projection horizon. 
Inflation is expected to return to the top of the 1%–3% control range by the end of 
2023 and to the 2% target by the end of 2024.
Key messages
	
 While inflation in Canada has declined from its peak, largely due to lower 
gasoline prices, it is still too high, and underlying inflationary pressures remain 
elevated.
	
 The Canadian economy continues to operate with significant excess demand. 
Businesses are facing widespread labour shortages and continuing tight 
labour markets.
	
 Monetary policy is beginning to help rebalance supply and demand in the 
economy. Financial conditions have become more restrictive following a series 
of interest rate hikes. Firms’ investment and hiring plans are softening. Higher 
mortgage rates have led to significant declines in housing activity. Household 
spending on goods is slowing, and, as the effects of higher interest rates 
continue to work through the economy, spending on services is also expected 
to moderate. 
	
 The pace of economic growth in Canada is slowing and is expected to 
moderate further. Growth is projected to essentially stall later this year and 
through the first half of 2023. Reducing demand growth in the economy allows 
supply to catch up, bringing inflation down.
	
 Growth in gross domestic product (GDP) is projected to decline from about 
3¼% in 2022 to just under 1% in 2023. It then picks up modestly, reaching 2% 
in 2024. 
	
 Inflation is projected to ease as the economy responds to higher interest rates 
and as the effects of elevated commodity prices and supply disruptions fade. 
The Bank expects inflation to decline to around 3% in late 2023 and return to 
2% by the end of 2024.

Global economy
Global economy
Inflation has continued to rise across the world this past year, reaching 
highs that have not been seen for decades. Many central banks have swiftly 
raised their policy rates in response. Although commodity prices are well 
below their peak from earlier this year and inflationary pressures from supply 
challenges have recently subsided, underlying inflation has yet to ease in 
many countries. 
The tightening of global monetary and financial conditions and Russia’s 
invasion of Ukraine are weighing on business and consumer confidence as 
well as on economic activity around the world. The Bank is expecting a sharp 
slowdown in the global economy. In the United States, growth in household 
spending and investment has fallen markedly. These are important drivers 
of demand for Canadian exports. In the euro area, economic activity is 
expected to have started contracting in the second half of 2022 due to energy 
shortages and elevated uncertainty. While economic activity in China is 
recovering from the most recent round of lockdowns related to the COVID-19 
pandemic, the correction in China’s property sector continues to restrain 
growth. 
The rapid rise in US policy interest rates and the surge in the US dollar have 
both caused important spillovers onto global financial conditions. Debt-
servicing costs for many emerging-market economies (EMEs) are increasing, 
with some developing economies facing challenges servicing their debt. The 
appreciation of the US dollar also adds to inflationary pressures in many 
countries. 
Overall, the Bank of Canada projects global growth to decline from roughly 
3¼% in 2022 to about 1½% in 2023. This would mark the slowest rate 
of global growth since 1982, excluding the COVID-19 pandemic and the 
2008–09 global financial crisis. Growth is projected to pick up to around 
2½% in 2024, mainly as the effects of tighter monetary policy and financial 
conditions abate. 
Globally, inflation is expected to decline in 2024 to levels that are close to 
central banks’ targets. Lower commodity prices, easing supply challenges 
and slower demand growth due to monetary policy tightening are expected to 
reduce inflation over the projection horizon.
Compared with projections in the July Report, growth in regions important 
for the Canadian economy—such as the United States, the euro area and 
China—has been revised down significantly (Table 1 and Box 1).1

Changes to the economic projection since the July Report 
Global outlook
Since the July Report, economic growth has been 
revised down in regions of the world that are particularly 
important for the Canadian outlook: 
 
 In the United States, economic growth has been 
reduced markedly in 2023 and modestly in 2024. 
The main driver of this downward revision is tighter 
fi
 nancial conditions.
 
 In the euro area, economic growth has been revised 
down substantially in 2023 and 2024 due to new 
disruptions to energy supply, lower real incomes and 
the need for higher policy rates to combat increased 
infl
 ationary pressures.
 
 In China, the negative impacts of COVID-19 
lockdowns and the property market correction have 
been larger than expected, leaving growth lower 
throughout the projection horizon. 
On net, growth of global gross domestic product (GDP) 
is roughly ½
   a percentage point lower in 2023 and 2024 
compared with the July Report. Global infl
 ation has 
been revised up marginally by the end of the projection 
horizon, mainly due to stronger projected infl
 ation in the 
euro area.
Canadian outlook 
GDP growth in 2022 has been revised down by about 
¼ of a percentage point, to around 3¼%. It has been 
reduced by close to 1 percentage point in 2023 and 
almost ½ of a percentage point in 2024, to about 1% and 
2%, respectively. These revisions leave the level of real 
GDP about 1½% lower by the end of 2024.
The following factors explain the downward revisions to 
the outlook for economic growth: 
 
 Potential output growth has been revised down. 
The negative effects of supply chain disruptions 
on productivity and of labour market mismatch that 
were previously assumed to be temporary are now 
assumed to be permanent. Higher net immigration 
partially offsets this downward revision (see Box 4 
on page 21).
 
 Financial conditions are tighter, and wealth is 
lower than expected. Household spending has 
consequently been revised down. 
 
 Exports have been revised down because of a lower 
path for commodity prices and a weaker projection 
for foreign demand. The depreciation of the 
Canadian dollar partially offsets these effects.
(continued…)
Broad-based inflation
Much of the world is experiencing high inflation (Chart 1). However, price 
increases have recently slowed due to declines in commodity prices. 
Moreover, pressures on inflation for prices of durable goods have lessened. 
This easing is partly due to lower transportation costs between Asia and 
other continents (Chart 2). As well, supplier delivery times are showing signs 
of normalizing. Despite these developments, underlying inflation remains 
elevated.

BANK OF CANADA  •  Monetary Policy Report  •  October 2022
Box 1 (continued)
 
 Business investment is anticipated to be lower due 
to tighter-than-expected fi
 nancial conditions, weaker 
foreign demand and the recent depreciation of the 
Canadian dollar, which raises the price in Canadian 
dollars of imported machinery and equipment.
Consumer price index (CPI) infl
 ation in 2022 and 2023 
is anticipated to be lower than previously projected. The 
outlook for CPI infl
 ation has been revised down by ¼ of 
a percentage point to just under 7% in 2022 and by ½ of 
a percentage point to about 4% in 2023. The outlook for 
infl
 ation in 2024 is largely unchanged. The downward 
revisions are mainly due to lower gasoline prices and 
weaker demand. Easing global cost pressures, including 
lower-than-expected shipping costs, also contribute to 
reducing infl
 ation in 2023. The weaker Canadian dollar 
partially offsets these cost pressures.

 ation is high across many G20 economies

The sources and intensity of inflationary pressures differ significantly across 
regions: 
	
 In the United States, measures of near-term inflation expectations have 
fallen slightly but are still considerably higher than the Federal Reserve’s 
inflation target. Moreover, rates of job openings, separations, quits and 
unemployment continue to signal a tight labour market, with employment 
gains outpacing growth in the working-age population. Wages continue to 
rise rapidly. 
	
 In the euro area, inflation is high and broadening across categories. 
Energy shortages are the main factor behind inflationary pressures, 
particularly after Russia further restricted natural gas exports. A tight 
labour market is also a factor, but it plays a smaller role. 
	
 Elevated commodity prices have added to inflation worldwide. The 
appreciation of the US dollar is contributing to imported inflation in 
countries that have seen their currencies depreciate.2
The Bank forecasts that inflation globally will decline steadily. The tightening 
in financial conditions plays an important role in reducing demand growth and 
inflation over the projection. 
2	 In the United States, by contrast, many imported goods are priced in US dollars. As a result, the pass-
through effects of a currency appreciation tend to appear only partially and do so gradually over time.

Report
Tightening financial conditions and rising US dollar 
Global financial conditions are markedly more restrictive than they were 
at the time of the July Report largely because many central banks have 
continued to tighten monetary policy.3 Global government bond yields have 
climbed quickly since the beginning of the year, leading to a repricing in 
global equities and other risky assets. The rapid rise in US interest rates 
and safe-haven flows resulting from concerns about a global recession have 
contributed to a substantial appreciation of the US dollar (Chart 3). While 
the Canadian dollar held steady against its US counterpart for most of the 
year, it has depreciated recently. The economic projection assumes the 
Canadian dollar will remain close to its average of around 74 cents US since 
September, 4 cents lower than assumed in July (Box 2).
As central banks in many countries raise their policy rates to address 
inflationary pressures, abrupt movements in risky asset prices and increased 
liquidity needs could occur. Financial vulnerabilities that have been building 
for some time—including high indebtedness and stretched asset valuations—
could magnify the impact of global tightening. Moreover, a higher US dollar 
could amplify funding problems faced by some EMEs that have borrowed 
extensively in that currency. 
Further moderation in US activity
Economic activity in the United States is slowly expanding after having 
contracted over the first half of the year. Overall, GDP in 2022 is forecast 
to grow by roughly 1¾%. Components of US activity that are important for 
Canadian exports are anticipated to weaken further over the projection horizon. 
3	 Since the start of 2022, the US Federal Reserve has increased the target range of the federal funds 
rate by 300 basis points and has started to reduce its balance sheet. The European Central Bank has 
increased the deposit facility rate by 125 basis points over the same period. Both central banks have 
communicated that they will likely implement further interest rate hikes.

Box 2
Key inputs to the projection
The Bank of Canada’s projection is conditional on 
several key assumptions, and changes to these will 
affect the outlook for the Canadian economy. The Bank 
regularly reviews these assumptions and how they may 
impact the economic projection. The key inputs into the 
Bank’s projection are as follows:
 
 In Canada, almost all public health restrictions 
have been lifted, and pandemic-related effects on 
consumer demand are assumed to have dissipated. 
Moreover, the Bank now assumes that households 
are consuming from their stock of extra savings 
accumulated during the pandemic as they would 
from their other savings.
 
 The projection incorporates information from all 
provincial and federal budgets available at the time 
of writing.
 
 Oil prices have declined since the July Report. The 
per-barrel prices in US dollars are assumed to be 
$95 for Brent, $90 for West Texas Intermediate and 
$75 for Western Canadian Select. Prices in the 
fourth quarter are US$15 lower than assumed in July 
but are only US$5 lower by the end of the projection 
(Chart 2-A). The risk of price movements in either 
direction is viewed as roughly balanced. 
 
 By convention, the Bank does not forecast the 
exchange rate in the Monetary Policy Report. 
The Canadian dollar is assumed to remain at 
74 cents US over the projection horizon, close to its 
recent average and below the 78 cents US assumed 
in the July Report.
 
 With this Report, the Bank is ending its distinction 
between supply and potential output. The Bank 
made that distinction in recent Reports to account 
for the episodic nature of some supply decreases 
caused by pandemic-related factors. With most 
public health restrictions removed, this distinction is 
no longer meaningful. It is therefore appropriate to 
now interpret assumptions about potential output as 
also refl
 ecting the expected evolution of supply. The 
difference between real gross domestic product and 
potential output refl
 ects the output gap.
 
 Potential output growth in Canada is assumed to 
increase from about ¾% in 2022 to just over 2% in 
2023 and 2024. These growth rates are slower than 
assumed for the growth of supply in the July Report, 
leaving the level of potential output at the end of 
2024 about 1½% lower than the level of supply in the 
July Report. For more details on the Bank’s potential 
output growth projection and revisions, see Box 4 
on page 21.
 
 The Bank estimates that the output gap was 
between 0.25% and 1.25% in the third quarter of 
2022, similar to the estimate for the second quarter 
provided in the July Report. 
 
 The nominal neutral policy interest rate is defi
 ned as 
the real neutral rate plus 2% for infl
 ation. The real 
neutral rate is defi
 ned as the rate consistent with 
both output remaining sustainably at its potential and 
infl
 ation remaining at target, on an ongoing basis. It 
is a medium- to long-term equilibrium concept. For 
Canada, the projection assumes that the nominal 
neutral rate is at the midpoint of the estimated range 
of 2% to 3%. This range was last reassessed in the 
April 2022 Report.

July Report
Consumption growth wanes as demand for in-person services stabilizes and 
household budgets are squeezed by high inflation and rising interest rates. 
Together, the slowdown in domestic demand and tighter borrowing conditions 
are projected to hamper business investment and industrial production. These 
factors are expected to dampen US output in 2023 before growth picks up over 
2024.
Multiple headwinds in the euro area 
In the euro area, activity is forecast to contract through the first quarter of 
2023. The decline is mainly driven by severe supply disruptions caused by 
Russian restrictions of natural gas exports and other shortages related to 
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Tighter monetary policy and lower confidence 
also dampen demand growth over the projection.
GDP is projected to grow around 3% in 2022 but to contract ½% in 2023. 
While a modest rebound is expected in 2024, the outlook remains highly 
uncertain.
Property market stress in China 
As the most severe effects of pandemic-related lockdowns fade, China’s 
economy appears to have partially rebounded. Activity is forecast to pick 
up further as the manufacturing sector recovers and in-person activities 
gradually resume. Containment measures in China are assumed to become 
less frequent and more targeted over the remainder of 2022 and 2023. 
Ongoing challenges related to its property market will continue to weigh on 
growth. 
Risks to economic activity are tilted to the downside. Authorities face a 
delicate balancing act between supporting growth, maintaining a “zero-
COVID” policy and addressing financial vulnerabilities. 
Sluggish growth in emerging-market economies and 
the rest of the world
Economic growth in oil-importing EMEs and the rest-of-the-world group is 
subdued and expected to remain so over the projection horizon. Russia’s 
invasion of Ukraine and tight financial conditions have created headwinds 
in both regions. Some emerging markets have experienced capital 
outflows—particularly those with weaker macroeconomic fundamentals. 
The appreciation of the US dollar also risks creating additional issues for 
debt sustainability in countries with significant debt denominated in US 
dollars. The moderation in growth that began in 2022 is expected to continue 
through 2023. In 2024, growth is projected to rise as the effects of headwinds 
dissipate.
Falling commodity prices
Prices for Brent oil have declined since the July Report (Chart 4). Falling 
economic growth worldwide, due in part to tighter monetary policy globally 
and softening demand in China, has contributed to the decline in prices. 
These factors are outweighing the effects of the recent decision by the 
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and some non-OPEC 
oil producers (OPEC+) to cut oil production.
	
Global economy	 8
 
	
BANK OF CANADA  •  Monetary Policy Report  •  October 2022
Looking ahead, the Bank assumes that prices for Brent oil will stay near 
current levels. Prices for West Texas Intermediate and Western Canadian 
Select are assumed to be US$5 and US$20 below Brent prices, respectively 
(Box 2).
Natural gas prices are below those at the time of the July Report, and they 
have become more volatile. Russia’s threat to cut off gas supplies to Europe 
this coming winter led to a price spike in that region. European prices then 
fell after gas storage facilities were filled ahead of schedule. Movements 
in European prices have had spillovers onto prices in Asia and, to a lesser 
extent, North America.
Since the July Report, the Bank’s non-energy commodity price index has 
declined by roughly 5%. The largest drop was in forestry prices, due to 
slowing housing activity in North America. Agricultural prices have eased 
as a number of regions have reported bumper harvests and war-related 
disruptions have had a smaller effect than first projected.

Canadian economy
The rise in inflation in Canada through 2022 has been pronounced and has 
broadened over time. Demand for goods and, in particular, services has 
outpaced supply, and measures of core inflation continue to be elevated. 
Household and business expectations for inflation over the next two years 
remain high. The longer high inflation lasts and the more pervasive it 
becomes, the greater the risk that it becomes entrenched.
To lower inflation, the Bank of Canada rapidly raised its policy rate and is 
undertaking quantitative tightening. These actions, combined with interest 
rate increases by the US Federal Reserve and other central banks, have 
led to a rapid tightening in domestic financial conditions over the past year. 
As a result, economic growth in Canada is slowing, allowing supply to catch 
up with demand. Housing activity has fallen sharply from the exceptional 
peak recorded earlier this year. Household spending on goods is slowing, 
and firms’ plans for investment and hiring are softening. The slowdown in 
economic activity abroad, particularly in the United States, has also begun 
to weigh on exports. Over the projection, the weaker Canadian dollar is 
expected to offset some of the impact on exports coming from slowing foreign 
demand.  
Economic growth is forecast to slow from 3¼% in 2022 to just under 1% 
in 2023. It picks up to 2% in 2024 as the impact of higher interest rates on 
Canadian growth fades, potential output growth picks up and foreign demand 
stabilizes (Table 2).
Inflation has declined since June, primarily due to lower gasoline prices. It 
continues to decrease over the projection horizon, reaching around 3% by the 
end of 2023 and returning to the 2% target by the end of 2024. The decrease 
in inflation occurs as higher interest rates in Canada and abroad continue 
to work their way through the economy and the impact of global supply 
disruptions fades.

BANK OF CANADA  •  Monetary Policy Report  •  October 2022
Persistently high inflation 
At 6.9% in September, inflation in Canada was well above the Bank’s target. 
Inflation is broad-based, with almost two-thirds of the components of the consumer 
price index (CPI) showing price increases of greater than 5% over the past year. For 
example, food price inflation and services price inflation have been high (Box 3). 
However, due to falling gasoline prices, inflation has been declining from its 8.1% 
peak in June (Chart 5). Prices for agricultural products have also tapered off, as 
have the inflationary pressures from global supply bottlenecks. These forces are 
expected to pass through to lower food and goods price inflation in the months 
ahead.

Box 3
Shelter and food infl
 ation 
High infl
 ation is stretching household budgets and 
creating hardship for many families in Canada. This is 
evident in the rise in shelter costs and food prices, which 
form approximately 40% of the CPI basket and typically 
make up a greater share of spending for lower-income 
Canadians.1
Shelter price infl
 ation was close to 7% earlier this 
year and remains elevated (Chart 3-A). Three main 
components drive shelter prices in the CPI: 
 
 homeowners’ replacement cost, which represents 
24% of the category
 
 mortgage interest cost, which makes up 11%
 
 rent, which represents 24%2 
Homeowners’ replacement cost infl
 ation, constructed 
from the New Housing Price Index, peaked at 14% 
in the fall of 2021 as house prices boomed during 
the pandemic. It has since eased to about 8% as the 
housing market has slowed in response to higher 
interest rates.  
Infl
 ation rates for the other two main components of 
shelter have been rising. Mortgage interest cost, which 
mainly refl
 ects changes in interest rates, turned positive 
in April on a month-over-month basis and is now up 
about 8% year-over-year. Rent price infl
 ation is also 
elevated at 4% year-over-year because demand for 
rental accommodation has increased. This demand 
has several sources, including a strong resumption of 
immigration and the return of students to out-of-town 
universities.
Food price infl
 ation picked up over 2022 and is now 
more than 11% on a year-over-year basis (Chart 3-B). 
Elevated food infl
 ation is widespread: of the 20 major 
components of the CPI’s “food purchased from stores” 
category, over four-fi
 fths are above 7%. Food products 
that require more processing have seen the biggest 
price increases. For example, while prices of meat and 
fresh vegetables are increasing at roughly 8% and 12%, 
respectively, those of bakery and cereal products (which 
includes pasta) and condiments are up more than 16% 
and 12%, respectively.  
1 Food refers to food purchased from stores and excludes meals in 
restaurants. Shelter excludes utilities other than water.
2 The remaining 41% of shelter in the CPI captures other costs, such 
as insurance, property taxes, water, maintenance and other owned 
accommodation expenses.

BANK OF CANADA  •  Monetary Policy Report  •  October 2022
In Canada, the demand for goods and services is outpacing the economy’s 
ability to supply them. Businesses continue to report widespread labour 
shortages. And strong demand has led to a sharp rise in the prices of 
services. 
This strong and persistent demand is reflected in the Bank’s measures of 
core inflation. CPI-median and CPI-trim are currently at 4.7% and 5.2%, 
respectively. For more on core inflation measures, see the Appendix on 
page 28. 
Inflation is typically reported on a year-over-year basis to smooth out some 
of the fluctuations that occur in higher-frequency measures. However, 
movements over a 12-month period do not provide as timely an assessment 
of inflationary pressures as those measures that focus on the most recent 
data do. Three-month measures of inflation are both more timely and more 
volatile than year-over-year measures. 
Largely due to the drop in gasoline prices, 3-month CPI inflation has fallen 
sharply and is now well below the year-over-year measure. Measures of 
3-month core inflation point to a slowdown to around 4% (Chart 6). This 
reflects fewer near-term price pressures from durable goods and shelter. 
At the same time, however, food price inflation and services price inflation 
(excluding shelter) have been showing strong momentum (Chart 7). 
Box 3 (continued)
Several factors are behind the high infl
 ation of food 
prices. Agricultural commodity prices had increased 
dramatically since mid-2020, hitting a peak earlier 
this year (Chart 3-C). Moreover, the past increase 
in commodity input costs is still being passed on to 
consumers. High distribution costs and increases in 
processing costs, such as energy inputs and labour 
costs, are also contributing to food price infl
 ation. 
The decline in agricultural commodity prices in recent 
months, however, should start to put downward pressure 
on food price infl
 ation in the coming year.

Although 3-month measures of core inflation point to a lower level of 
underlying inflation than the year-over-year measure, their levels remain well 
above target. To see a clear decline in underlying inflation, a more sustained 
further decrease in the 3-month measures would be required. 
Elevated inflation expectations 
Most respondents to consumer and business surveys expect average CPI 
inflation over the next two years to be well above the 2% target (Chart 8). 
The distribution of survey responses remains markedly wider than before 
the pandemic, suggesting that the level of uncertainty about the future path 
of inflation over the next few years is still high. Moreover, more respondents 
expect inflation to be above target than below. At the same time, long-term 
expectations for CPI inflation—particularly those gathered from surveys of 
professional forecasters and measures based on financial markets—remain 
consistent with the 2% target. This indicates that longer-term expectations 
remain well anchored.
Recent dynamics are mixed. Consumers’ short-term CPI inflation 
expectations have continued to edge higher, driven by concerns about supply 
chain disruptions and oil prices. In contrast, the results of the Business 
Outlook Survey (BOS) for the third quarter of 2022 suggest that firms’ short-
term CPI inflation expectations have eased slightly. The share of firms 
expecting very large price increases has moderated (Chart 9).  
When it comes to expectations of their own input cost pressures and pricing, 
firms see inflation slowing. For the first time since mid-2020, firms now expect 
that cost and pricing pressures will be less intense than they were over the 
past 12 months (Chart 10).

Significant excess demand 
The strong labour market and persistent capacity constraints indicate that 
there is still substantial excess demand in the Canadian economy. The labour 
market continues to be tight across a broad range of measures, suggesting 
that it has surpassed maximum sustainable employment (Chart 11). The 
unemployment rate in September was 5.2%, one of the lowest rates in 
40 years. A historically high number of firms responding to the BOS stated 
that they are facing more intense labour shortages than they were a year ago. 
The ratios of vacancies and job postings to unemployed workers also remain 
close to their all-time highs. Over the last six months, wage growth has 
increased and broadened across sectors (Chart 12). 
Employment, however, has been softening in recent months, particularly in 
some sectors that are sensitive to interest rates, such as manufacturing and 
construction. This moderation also reflects an overall decline in the labour 
force participation rate since the beginning of the year, partly due to the 
increased number of retirements. 
Capacity constraints remain significant. Results from recent business surveys 
suggest that supply chain bottlenecks persist (Chart 13). In the BOS, firms 
report some reductions in lead times and increases in the availability of 
materials.
The Bank estimates that the output gap was between 0.25% and 1.25% in 
the third quarter of 2022, similar to the estimate for the second quarter.

Slowing demand growth and rising supply
Growth was robust in the first half of 2022 as the Canadian economy 
reopened. High commodity prices and the easing of public health restrictions 
were boosting economic activity. 
In the spring, rising mortgage rates contributed to a sharp slowing of housing 
resales, and, by the middle of the year, economic activity started showing 
signs of moderation. Growth is estimated to have eased to around 1½% in the 
third quarter. GDP growth is then projected to slow to between 0% and ½% 
through the end of 2022 and the first half of 2023 (Table 3 and Chart 14). 
This suggests that a couple of quarters with growth slightly below zero is just 
as likely as a couple of quarters with small positive growth.

BANK OF CANADA  •  Monetary Policy Report  •  October 2022
The slowdown reflects tighter financial conditions that are weighing heavily 
on household demand and business investment. As the boost from pent-up 
demand for in-person services fades, consumption growth softens. Weaker 
foreign demand, particularly in the United States, leads to a decline in export 
growth. The recent depreciation of the Canadian dollar partially offsets this 
impact.
Starting in the second half of 2023, GDP growth picks up as the effect 
of interest rate increases subsides and potential output recovers. Robust 
immigration also supports a pickup in housing demand in 2024. Quarterly 
growth in exports increases following a resumption of economic growth in the 
United States. 
Growth in potential output rises from around ¾% in 2022 to about 2% in 
2023 and 2024. Record immigration, fewer supply chain issues and easing 
of other pandemic-related factors, such as public health measures, support 
potential output growth (Box 4).
With soft demand growth and solid potential output growth, excess demand 
in the Canadian economy turns into excess supply in early 2023. 
Lower household spending growth
Household spending is expected to contract modestly in the fourth quarter 
of 2022 and through the first half of 2023. Higher interest rates weigh on 
household spending, with housing and big-ticket items being the most 
affected (Chart 15). Decreasing house prices, financial wealth and consumer 
confidence also restrain household spending. 
Borrowing costs have risen sharply. The costs for those taking on a new 
mortgage are up markedly. Households renewing an existing mortgage are 
facing a larger increase than has been experienced during any tightening 
cycle over the past 30 years. For example, a homeowner who signed a 
five-year fixed-rate mortgage in October 2017 would now be faced with a 
mortgage rate that is 1½ to 2 percentage points higher at renewal.

Box 4
Potential output in Canada 
Growth in potential output is expected to pick up from 
about 0.7% in 2022 to just over 2% in 2023 and 2024. 
It has been revised down by 0.5 percentage points, 
on average, in 2023 and 2024 compared with the July 
Report (Table 4-A).1 The downward revision reduces 
the size of the rebound in potential output growth over 
the projection. 
Trend labour productivity growth over the forecast has 
been revised down. Supply challenges have proved 
to be quite persistent, which suggests that larger 
restructuring and reallocation issues are at play. The 
Bank of Canada’s consultations reveal that businesses 
will continue to adjust—for example, by sourcing from 
new suppliers, rearranging their global value chains or 
holding more inventories. Consequently, supply chains, 
in the medium term, will not return to their pre-pandemic 
form as previously assumed.
In addition, trend labour input growth is lower in 2023 
than assumed in the July Report. Labour market 
mismatch—the gap between the skills, interests and 
experience of job seekers and the types of workers 
employers are looking for—is assumed to have more 
persistent impacts on the ability of fi
 rms in many 
industries to hire workers. Furthermore, illness-related 
absences appear to be more frequent than before the 
pandemic. These factors are partially offset by upward 
revisions to net immigration fl
 ows. 
1 The pandemic has had both temporary and lasting effects on the supply side of 
the economy. Recent issues of the Report distinguished between supply and 
potential output to account for the episodic nature of some decreases in supply 
caused by pandemic-related factors, such as public health measures and 
supply chain disruptions. Elevated uncertainty about the likely persistence and 
timing over which these factors could dissipate makes this distinction artifi
 cially 
precise. The impact of these factors on potential output is now included in 
estimates of trend total factor productivity and trend labour input.
The rebound in potential output growth in 2023 and 
2024 is supported by strong immigration and a recovery 
in trend labour productivity growth. After declining 
sharply at the height of the pandemic, net immigration 
surged by about 270,000 people in the second quarter 
of 2022—by far the highest single-quarter increase in 
Canadian history. In line with the federal government’s 
target to welcome 1.3 million permanent residents over 
2022–24, net immigration accounts for more than two-
thirds of potential output growth.

The rise in mortgage rates contributed to a sharp pullback in resales beginning 
in March. Resales have continued to decline and are now below pre-pandemic 
levels (Chart 16). Renovation activity has also weakened. The contraction in 
residential investment that began in the second quarter of the year is projected 
to continue through the first half of 2023, although to a lesser degree. House 
prices, which rose by just over 50% between February 2020 and February 2022, 
have declined by just under 10%.4 They are projected to continue to decline, 
particularly in those markets that saw larger increases during the pandemic.
4	 These figures use the MLS Home Price Index®, which provides a measure of real estate prices that 
adjusts for the quality of the home.
Box 4 (continued)
Trend labour productivity growth recovers to just 
below 1% in 2023 and 2024. This largely refl
 ects an 
improvement in total factor productivity growth as the 
drag from supply challenges and other pandemic-related 
factors fades.
Growth of potential output in Canada is assumed to 
exceed that in the United States in 2023 and 2024. Over 
that period, potential output grows by about 2.1% on 
average in Canada, 0.4 percentage points higher than in 
the United States (Table 4-B). Over the projection, net 
immigration fl
 ows of working-age individuals make up on 
average 1.2 percentage points of potential output growth 
in Canada, compared with 0.3 percentage points in the 
United States.2 In contrast, trend labour productivity 
2 In addition to contributing to working-age population growth, immigration 
supports potential output growth by increasing trend employment rates. This 
is because the proportion of prime-age workers among working-age people 
is larger for immigrants than it is for the general Canadian population. These 
fi
 gures do not include these secondary effects on potential output.
growth is assumed to be lower in Canada than in the

decades.

Higher borrowing costs are affecting spending on big-ticket items. Spending 
on automobiles, furniture and appliances is the most sensitive to interest 
rates and is already showing signs of slowing. As higher interest rates work 
their way through the economy, disposable income growth and the demand 
for services will also slow. Past experience suggests that the demand for 
travel, hotels, meals at restaurants and communications services will be 
impacted the most. 
Household spending strengthens beginning in the second half of 2023 and 
extends through 2024. Population growth and rising disposable incomes 
support demand as the impact of the tightening in financial conditions wanes. 
For example, new residential construction is boosted by strong immigration in 
markets that are already particularly tight.
Slowing business investment
Business investment growth is projected to slow markedly from about 6¾% 
in 2022 to around 1½% in 2023 before increasing modestly to 2¼% in 2024 
(Chart 17). 
According to results of the BOS, investment intentions are positive partly 
because capacity constraints remain significant for many businesses. In 2023, 
growth in business investment spending is expected to slow due to higher 
financing costs, softening demand and moderating capacity constraints. 
Rising bank lending rates, widening corporate spreads and falling equity 
markets have contributed to substantial increases in financing costs for 
many businesses. For example, the average borrowing rate for new business 
loans has risen by about 3 percentage points over the past year. The recent 
depreciation of the Canadian dollar, which makes investment in machinery 
and equipment more expensive, also weighs on business investment. 
Growth picks up in 2024 when demand strengthens across the economy. 
Projects such as the development of electric vehicle production facilities also 
contribute to the uptick.

Investment growth in the oil and gas sector is anticipated to be solid due 
to relatively high energy prices. However, investment will be restrained by 
ongoing uncertainty about long-term demand and the transition to a low-
carbon economy.
Inventory investment is projected to moderate in 2023 following exceptional 
strength. The easing in global supply chain disruptions will gradually help 
efforts to restock, particularly by retailers, following pandemic-related 
shortages. Firms are assumed to hold more inventories to buffer themselves 
against future supply disruptions and build resilience in their production chains.
Moderate export growth 
Exports grow moderately over the projection horizon. Growth of non-
commodity exports through 2023 slows because of weakening foreign 
demand. The recovery in international travel, the continued easing of global 
supply chain disruptions and the recent depreciation of the Canadian dollar 
provide a partial offset. As foreign demand stabilizes through 2024, non-
commodity exports gradually strengthen (Chart 18). 
Non-energy commodity exports grow moderately in 2023, partly reflecting the 
anticipated return of crop yields to normal levels as well as fewer effects from 
global supply chain disruptions.
Over the projection horizon, energy exports are supported by high prices and 
increased transportation capacity. In 2024, growth should pick up due to the 
expected completion of key projects such as the Trans Mountain Expansion 
pipeline. 
A gradual recovery in business investment spending and ongoing restocking 
by firms will support imports of goods.

CPI inflation is forecast to decline from around 7% in the fourth quarter of 
2022 to within the 1%–3% target range by the end of 2023 and to return to 
the 2% target by the end of 2024 (Chart 19). Inflation falls as the effects of 
past increases in commodity prices dissipate and the inflationary pressures 
from global supply disruptions fade. Other factors (Chart 19, yellow bars) are 
also expected to ease. These potentially include the pass-through of elevated 
energy costs to the prices of other goods and services as well as elevated 
shelter costs. Specifically, high energy costs seem to have passed through to 
inflation much more than is usual. It will take some time for these unusually 
large impacts to fully recede.
The rise in interest rates slows spending, reduces demand and helps return 
inflation back to target. In particular, moderating demand leads to a softening 
of inflation of services prices. This includes lower house prices and declining 
shelter price inflation through mid-2023. Shelter price inflation, however, 
remains positive due to the lasting effect of increased mortgage interest costs 
and strong growth in rent.5 
The recent depreciation of the Canadian dollar provides a modest boost to 
import prices and inflation in 2023.
5	 The increase in mortgage interest costs is projected to add an average of around 0.6 percentage points 
to inflation over 2023–24.

Risks to the inflation outlook
Risks to the inflation outlook
The global economy faces a growing set of complex challenges and risks. 
In most countries, inflation remains high and widespread. Many central 
banks have rapidly raised interest rates, and some have begun to shrink 
their balance sheets. Financial conditions have tightened sharply in 2022, 
increasing financial stresses. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and rising 
geopolitical tensions remain major sources of uncertainty. 
Some of the risks identified in previous issues of the Report have been 
partially incorporated into the projection. The base-case scenario includes 
weaker global growth, lower commodity prices and transportation costs, 
tighter global financial conditions and a sharper near-term decline in 
Canadian housing activity.
The Bank sees two main risks to the outlook for inflation. On the upside, inflation 
may remain higher for longer than anticipated in the base case. One way this 
could occur is if inflation expectations do not adjust downward as expected. In 
this case, the wage-price spiral risk scenario described in the July Report could 
be realized. Other factors could also lead to stickier inflation than projected in the 
base case. On the downside, the slowdown in the global economy could be even 
more severe and inflation would fall further than projected.
While the Bank views the risks around its inflation outlook as roughly 
balanced, the upside risk is of greater concern because inflation is 
persistently high.
Main upside risk: High inflation that is more persistent 
Inflation could persist at a rate higher than expected in the base case. This 
risk could arise through either global or domestic channels. 
Some global factors responsible for recent high inflation could last longer 
than assumed in the base case or have a greater impact on consumer prices 
than anticipated. For example, an intensification of the supply disruptions 
related to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine could trigger spikes in the prices 
of oil, natural gas and agricultural products. More broadly, an increase in 
geopolitical tensions could prolong disruptions to supply chains, risking 
higher prices on internationally traded goods. 
Domestic factors could also keep inflation high for longer than anticipated. 
Short-term inflation expectations have increased considerably since the 
onset of the pandemic. If these expectations prove to be more persistent than 
anticipated in the base case, inflation will remain higher for longer. 
Another risk is that households may tap into their elevated levels of savings 
more than anticipated in the base case. This would lead to increased 
household spending and greater upward pressure on inflation.

BANK OF CANADA  •  Monetary Policy Report  •  October 2022
Main downside risk: Severe global slowdown 
As monetary policy tightens in many countries, long-standing global 
financial vulnerabilities could amplify the impacts on the global economy. 
Many countries have high levels of sovereign, non-financial corporate and 
household debt. Significant external and US-dollar borrowing is an additional 
vulnerability for several EMEs. Some funding markets have become more 
fragile due to lower levels of liquidity. An abrupt repricing of risk could 
trigger funding strains for higher-risk borrowers and a prolonged period of 
deleveraging. The result could lead to a more severe global slowdown and 
lower commodity prices. 
The Canadian economy could be affected through weaker foreign demand, 
lower terms of trade and spillovers into its financial system. The resulting 
tighter financial conditions and higher unemployment could undermine 
homebuyer sentiment and lead to a larger-than-expected drop in house 
prices. This in turn could reduce household wealth, access to credit and 
consumer confidence.
The base case assumes that the spike in goods prices since the beginning 
of the pandemic will persist. These prices could decline, however, if the 
slowdown in global growth proves to be more severe than anticipated. 
A sharper slowdown in growth, notably in the United States, could push down 
goods prices if retailers who find themselves with too much inventory offer 
deep discounts.

core inflation 
core inflation 
Inflation can be quite volatile. To help see through the excess volatility in 
inflation data, central banks often use measures of core inflation. Because 
no core measure is clearly superior, the Bank of Canada considers multiple 
approaches, each of which has its strengths and weaknesses. CPI-trim and 
CPI-median have both proved to be reliable indicators of underlying inflation 
throughout the pandemic. In contrast, CPI-common has become unreliable 
in real time because it has been subject to large revisions. Consequently, 
the Bank will focus on CPI-trim and CPI-median as its preferred measures of 
core inflation.
Several measures of core inflation
Since 2016, the Bank has used three measures of core inflation: CPI-trim, 
CPI-median and CPI-common. CPI-trim recalculates inflation after excluding 
the most extreme (high and low) price changes each month. Similarly, CPI-
median represents the midpoint of the distribution of monthly price changes. 
CPI-common isolates common price changes across the CPI basket and 
recalculates inflation by giving more importance to the components that 
moved closely together over history.
The Bank chose these measures, among many alternatives, mainly because 
they:
	
 have moved most closely with the key macroeconomic factors behind 
inflation 
	
 have best captured underlying inflation after seeing through temporary 
fluctuations
Mixed signals throughout the pandemic
The pandemic presented an unprecedented and complex shock that 
has challenged conventional economic models and indicators, including 
measures of core inflation. Importantly, these measures sometimes gave 
mixed signals about underlying inflation.

CPI-trim and CPI-median
CPI-trim and CPI-median appear to have provided an accurate gauge of 
underlying inflation during the pandemic (Chart A-1, panel a).6 The reason 
is that, unlike other core measures that rely on the past behaviour of prices, 
these measures are based on the distribution of price changes each month. 
Their relative flexibility made CPI-trim and CPI-median well suited to deal 
with the unfamiliarity of the pandemic and capture important changes in the 
behaviour of inflation. 
Many of the CPI components that were most volatile at the onset of the 
pandemic had not typically been so volatile before. Extreme price movements 
on the high side and low side were also more common. 
As a result, CPI-trim and CPI-median eased modestly below the 2% target 
as the economy weakened at the beginning of the pandemic, but they did 
not fall as much as other measures of core inflation. By early 2021, CPI-trim 
and CPI-median both slightly exceeded 2%, providing an earlier warning 
than other core measures that underlying inflation was rising. By mid-2021, 
high inflation continued to broaden across the CPI basket. This was clearly 
reflected in the subsequent behaviour of CPI-trim and CPI-median. In 2022, 
the two measures continued to rise, reaching well above the 2% target. At the 
same time, total inflation reached highs not seen in decades, and inflationary 
pressures became unambiguously widespread.
CPI-common
CPI-common was relatively slow to show a lasting increase in inflation 
(Chart A-1, panel b).7 One reason for this was how it treated price changes 
of internationally traded goods. Before the pandemic, these prices tended

not to move much with the rest of the components of the CPI basket. As a 
result, CPI-common did not place much emphasis on the strong inflationary 
pressures coming from internationally traded goods prices in 2021. The 
resulting real-time estimate of CPI-common was notably lower than the 
estimate provided by CPI-trim and CPI-median. With the common price 
movements in the CPI components becoming more widespread than in the 
pre-pandemic period, the estimated weight on traded goods prices in CPI-
common increased. Consequently, estimates of CPI-common during the 
pandemic have been revised up substantially, and these revised estimates 
are similar to those for CPI-trim and CPI-median throughout the pandemic. 
Alternative measures of core inflation
The Bank also monitors alternative measures of core inflation, notably CPIX 
and CPI-XFET.8 These exclusion-based measures remove a fixed group 
of CPI components that have historically tended to be more volatile. For 
example, CPI-XFET excludes food and energy. This approach differs from 
that used in CPI-trim and CPI-median, which exclude different components 
each month. 
At the onset of the pandemic, CPIX and CPI-XFET fell sharply toward the 
lower end of the Bank’s inflation-control range, suggesting less underlying 
inflation than CPI-trim and CPI-median did. This happened because the 
exclusion-based measures did not reflect the changes in the most volatile 
components that occurred at the beginning of the pandemic. CPIX and CPI-
XFET then remained below the 2% target for about one year before moving 
largely together with CPI-trim and CPI-median (Chart A-2).

Core inflation increasingly important
Measures of core inflation can help detect important and lasting changes 
in inflation. CPI-common is no longer informative in real time because it 
has been subject to large historical revisions. In contrast, CPI-trim and CPI-
median better capture changes in price behaviour. These measures appear 
to have performed well during the pandemic and are subject to much smaller 
revisions. Going forward, the Bank’s focus will be on these two measures.
