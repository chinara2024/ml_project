The Bank of Canada today announced that it is raising its target for the overnight
rate by one-quarter of one percentage point to 1 per cent. The Bank Rate is
correspondingly 1 1/4 per cent and the deposit rate is 3/4 per cent.
The global economic recovery is proceeding but remains uneven, balancing strong
activity in emerging market economies with weak growth in some advanced
economies. In the United States, the recovery in private demand is being held
back by high unemployment and recent indicators suggest a more muted
recovery in the near term.
Economic activity in Canada was slightly softer in the second quarter than the
Bank had expected, although consumption and investment have evolved largely
as anticipated.  Going forward, consumption growth is expected to remain solid
and business investment to rise strongly. Both are being supported by
accommodative credit conditions, which have eased in recent weeks mainly owing
to sharp declines in global bond yields.
The Bank now expects the economic recovery in Canada to be slightly more
gradual than it had projected in its July Monetary Policy Report (MPR), largely
reflecting a weaker profile for U.S. activity. Inflation in Canada has been broadly in
line with the Bank's expectations and its dynamics are essentially unchanged.
Against this backdrop, the Bank decided to increase its target for the overnight
rate to 1 per cent. As a result of monetary policy measures taken since April,
financial conditions in Canada have tightened modestly but remain exceptionally
stimulative. This is consistent with achieving the 2 per cent inflation target in an
environment of significant excess supply in Canada.
Any further reduction in monetary policy stimulus would need to be carefully
considered in light of the unusual uncertainty surrounding the outlook.
