The Bank of Canada today announced that it is lowering its target for the
overnight rate by one-quarter of one percentage point to 2 per cent. The
operating band for the overnight rate is correspondingly lowered, and the Bank
Rate is now 2 1/4 per cent.
The Canadian economy continues to adjust to developments in the global
economy. These include stronger world demand, higher commodity prices, the
realignment of world currencies, including the Canadian dollar, and the intensified
competition, together with the new trading opportunities, coming from emerging-
market economies. These developments require shifts in activity among sectors
and create a need for adjustments by many businesses. Monetary policy is
facilitating these adjustments by supporting aggregate demand, with the goal of
keeping the economy near its full potential and inflation on target.
The Bank's outlook for economic growth and inflation remains essentially
unchanged from the outlook published in the January Monetary Policy Report
Update. The economy is projected to return close to its production potential by
the third quarter of 2005 and core inflation is projected to move back to the 2 per
cent target by the end of 2005.
Against this backdrop, the Bank decided to lower the target for the overnight rate
by a further quarter percentage point.
The risks to the outlook now appear balanced. An elaboration of the Bank's views
on the outlook for inflation and the economy will be provided in the Monetary
Policy Report, to be released on 15 April 2004.
