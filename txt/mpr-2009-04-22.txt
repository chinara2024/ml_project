Canada’s Inflation-control strategy*
Inflation control and the economy
Inflation control is not an end in itself; it is the means whereby monetary policy contributes to 
• 
solid economic performance.
Low, stable, and predictable inflation allows the economy to function more effectively. This 
• 
contributes to better economic growth over time and works to moderate cyclical fluctuations in 
output and employment.
The monetary policy instrument
Announcements regarding the Bank’s policy instrument—the target overnight interest rate—take 
• 
place, under normal circumstances, on eight pre-specified dates during the year.
In setting a target for the overnight rate, the Bank of Canada influences short-term interest rates 
• 
to achieve a rate of monetary expansion consistent with the inflation-control target. The trans-
mission mechanism is complex and involves long and variable lags—the impact on inflation from 
changes in policy rates is usually spread over six to eight quarters.
The targets
In February 1991, the federal government and the Bank of Canada jointly agreed on a series of 
• 
targets for reducing total CPI inflation to the midpoint of a range of 1 to 3 per cent by the end of 
1995. The inflation target has been extended a number of times. In November 2006, the agree-
ment was renewed for a period of five years to the end of 2011. Under this agreement, the Bank 
will continue to conduct monetary policy aimed at keeping total CPI inflation at 2 per cent, with a 
control range of 1 to 3 per cent around the target.
Monitoring inflation
In the short run, a good deal of movement in the CPI is caused by transitory fluctuations in the 
• 
prices of such volatile components as fruit and gasoline, as well as by changes in indirect taxes. 
For this reason, the Bank uses a core measure of CPI inflation as an indicator of the underlying 
trend in inflation. This core measure excludes eight of the most volatile components of the CPI 
and adjusts the remaining components to remove the effect of changes in indirect taxes.

There is a plan to restore confidence and growth, we 
are implementing it, and it will work. The impact of 
these policies will build over time and will be signifi­
cant. For maximum effect, it is critical that measures 
be grounded in robust and principled frameworks: the 
objectives should be transparent; indicators of suc­
cess clear; and entry and exit criteria well articulated. 
Citizens must be able to hold their policy-makers 
accountable. Policy-makers must rise to the occasion.

Overview
BANK OF CANADA    MONETARY POLICY REPORT    April 2009 1
Overview
In an environment of continued high uncertainty, the global recession 
has intensified and become more synchronous since the Bank’s January 
Monetary Policy Report Update, with weaker-than-expected activity in all 
major economies. Deteriorating credit conditions have spread quickly through 
trade, financial, and confidence channels. While more aggressive monetary 
and fiscal policy actions are under way across the G-20, measures to sta­
bilize the global financial system have taken longer than expected to enact. 
As a result, the recession in Canada will be deeper than anticipated, with 
the economy projected to contract by 3.0 per cent in 2009. The Bank now 
expects the recovery to be delayed until the fourth quarter and to be more 
gradual. The economy is projected to grow by 2.5 per cent in 2010 and 4.7 per 
cent in 2011, and to reach its production capacity in the third quarter of 2011. 
Given significant restructuring in a number of sectors, potential growth has 
been revised down. The recovery will be importantly supported by the Bank’s 
accommodative monetary stance.
The Bank expects core inflation to diminish through 2009, gradually returning 
to the 2 per cent target in the third quarter of 2011 as aggregate supply and 
demand return to balance. Total CPI inflation is expected to trough at -0.8 per 
cent in the third quarter of 2009 and return to target in the third quarter of 
2011.
Global developments continue to pose significant risks to the Bank’s inflation 
projection for Canada, on both the upside and the downside. On the upside, 
confidence may return more rapidly than anticipated if convincing action is 
taken more quickly than assumed to address financial system weaknesses 
in major economies. This could result in a stronger-than-projected recovery 
in the global economy as the aggressive and coordinated macroeconomic 
policy actions already being implemented take effect. On the downside, the 
global recession could be deeper and more protracted than envisaged if the 
resolution of these financial system problems is delayed further. More gener­
ally, there are risks around the resolution of global imbalances. The underlying 
macroeconomic risks are roughly balanced.
When monetary policy is conducted at the effective lower bound, the uncer­
tainty regarding the effects of unconventional monetary policies in the event 
that the recession turns out to be more protracted than expected, and the 
resulting need for prudence in the use of these instruments, imply that 
the overall risks to the Bank’s inflation projection are tilted slightly to the 
downside.
On 21 April, the Bank lowered its target for the overnight rate by one-quarter 
of a percentage point to 1/4 per cent, which the Bank judges to be the

2
effective lower bound for that rate. Conditional on the outlook for inflation, 
the target overnight rate can be expected to remain at its current level until 
the end of the second quarter of 2010 in order to achieve the inflation target. 
The Bank will continue to provide guidance in its scheduled interest rate 
announcements as long as the overnight rate is at the effective lower bound.
To reinforce its conditional commitment to maintain the overnight rate at 
1/4 per cent, the Bank will roll over a portion of its existing stock of 1- and 
3-month term purchase and resale agreements (PRAs) into 6- and 12-month 
terms at minimum and maximum bid rates that correspond to the target rate 
and the Bank Rate, respectively.
The 21 April decision brings the cumulative monetary policy easing to 425 basis 
points since December 2007. It is the Bank’s judgment that this cumulative 
easing, together with the conditional commitment, is the appropriate policy 
stance to move the economy back to full production capacity and to achieve 
the 2 per cent inflation target.
The Bank retains considerable flexibility in the conduct of monetary policy at 
low interest rates. The Annex to this report describes the Bank of Canada’s 
approach to conducting monetary policy when the overnight interest rate is at 
the effective lower bound. Additional stimulus could be provided, if needed, 
through quantitative and/or credit easing. Definitions of these actions and the 
principles guiding their possible use can be found in the Annex.

Recent Developments
While the global recession has intensified since the January Update and 
become more synchronous, the broad profile of the Bank’s outlook remains 
consistent with the projection at that time. A deepening financial crisis in the 
United States and Europe triggered a severe recession in the global economy 
at the end of 2008, as deteriorating conditions in the advanced economies 
spread quickly around the world through trade, financial, and confidence 
channels. Concerted policy measures across the G-20 provide the neces­
sary and appropriate support for global recovery, although the recovery will 
be delayed by slower progress in stabilizing the global financial system than 
previously anticipated.
Heightened uncertainty surrounding the global outlook, together with 
declining wealth and tighter credit conditions, has adversely affected 
­
confidence levels, causing households and firms to cut back spending 
sharply. The knock-on effect on global trade has been much larger than 
expected, reflecting both a sudden collapse in trade credit and an abrupt 
inventory correction in the auto and electronics sectors. Export-oriented 
countries in Asia and Europe have experienced sharp declines in industrial 
production (Chart 1).
While the global recession has intensi-
fied and become more synchronous, 
the broad profile of the Bank’s outlook 
remains consistent with the January 
Update.

The pervasive and intense nature of the economic downturn has exacerbated 
strains on banks’ balance sheets and further constrained the availability 
of credit to businesses and households, leading to additional weakness in 
demand. As a result of this adverse feedback loop, global GDP growth has hit 
post–World War II lows in recent quarters.
Policy-makers in the major economies have responded to the global crisis 
with bold policy actions. The G-20 countries have committed to do whatever 
is necessary to restore growth and stability in their economies. Monetary 
authorities have lowered policy rates aggressively (Chart 2), and several cen­
tral banks have adopted unconventional monetary policy measures, including 
quantitative and credit easing. Fiscal authorities have introduced substantial 
stimulus packages to help offset the drop in domestic and foreign demand. 
The fact that these fiscal initiatives are being undertaken simultaneously in 
several countries will augment their impact. The effects of these policies will 
be increasingly felt over time and should reach full force in 2010.
Timely and credible action is required to address the impaired assets on 
bank balance sheets and to restore the normal flow of credit—a precondi­
tion for sustained economic recovery. Progress on these measures has been 
slower than expected in the United States and other major financial centres. 
However, comprehensive programs have recently been outlined to provide 
additional liquidity, guarantee bank balance sheets, dispose of bad assets, 
and recapitalize as appropriate. The challenge now is to ensure their rapid 
and effective implementation.
As anticipated in the January Update, economic activity in the United States 
contracted sharply in the fourth quarter of 2008, and recent indicators sug­
gest a similar contraction in the first quarter of 2009. The weakness was most 
evident in sectors that are particularly important for Canadian exports, mag­
nifying the effects of the U.S. downturn on the Canadian economy. U.S. resi­
dential construction has remained very weak, with a large overhang of unsold 
houses continuing to put downward pressure on house prices and building 
activity. Motor vehicle sales and production have also experienced a sharp 
cyclical and structural correction, as manufacturers cut output in response

to sagging demand, mounting losses, and limited access to auto financing. 
There are, nevertheless, early signs that activity levels in both the housing and 
auto sectors may be starting to stabilize in response to the sizable adjust­
ments that have taken place.
In Europe and Japan, the decline in output has been more acute than 
expected over the recent period, as falling external demand and mounting 
internal strains spilled over into the domestic economy. Deteriorating condi­
tions in housing markets, falling consumer and business confidence, and 
continuing difficulties in the financial sectors of many overseas countries 
have added to these external pressures. Japan and Germany have been 
particularly affected by the collapse in global demand for autos and IT-related 
goods, as well as by the past appreciations of their currencies. Output growth 
in China has moderated, but has nevertheless remained much stronger than 
that in most other emerging-market economies. Aggressive fiscal stimulus 
measures and monetary easing have boosted domestic demand and partly 
offset the fall in exports.
Following a sharp decline in the second half of 2008, commodity prices 
appear to have levelled off (Chart 3). Production cuts by OPEC have out-
paced the fall in global demand, contributing to a modest recovery in oil 
prices. While the price of natural gas has continued to decline, prices of 
other, ­
non-energy, commodities have recently increased.
Developments in Global Financial Markets 
As highlighted in the January Update, stabilization of the global financial 
system remains a precondition for economic recovery. Despite some recent 
signs of improvement, market conditions are mixed, and the outlook remains 
uncertain. On the positive side, there are indications that the aggressive 
actions taken by central banks and governments are beginning to gain trac­
tion, and volatility has fallen in a number of financial markets. In addition, 
Despite some recent signs of improve-
ment, market conditions are mixed, and 
the outlook remains uncertain.

stock markets, after reaching multi-year lows earlier this year, have started to 
price in a more positive outlook. Global credit markets, in contrast, are still 
fragile, with improvements largely confined to short-term funding markets 
(Chart 4), while longer-term spreads remain elevated. The cost of funds for 
business borrowers—especially lower-quality credit risks—also remains high, 
and ­
surveys of senior loan officers indicate that lending standards for con­
sumers continue to tighten, albeit at a slower pace.
Conditions in global financial markets over the next few quarters will be 
shaped by two main developments. The first concerns the weaker current 
state of the real economy and the additional credit-related losses that this 
might entail for financial institutions, as delinquencies and loan losses begin 
to rise. The second development relates to remedial efforts directed at the 
illiquid legacy assets on banks’ balance sheets. Stress tests designed to pro­
vide a credible and comprehensive assessment of the true situation, together 
with capital injections and guarantees, should facilitate price discovery, 
reduce concerns about counterparty risk, and boost liquidity. Although the 
normalization of financial conditions is likely to be delayed by the increased 
drag coming from the real economy and from the delayed implementation 
of remedial measures in the banking sector, on balance, more widespread 
improvements should become evident by mid-2010.
Outlook for the Global Economy
Global economic growth for 2009 has been revised down in the Bank’s latest 
projection, reflecting the recent sharp decline in economic activity. The growth 
profile also incorporates a delayed and slightly more protracted recovery 
compared with that in the January Update. As a result, output growth is now 
projected to remain negative for most of 2009 and to begin to absorb excess 
production capacity only towards the middle of 2010. The return to potential 
will be postponed by the self-reinforcing nature of the adverse feedback loop

that has developed, and by the additional drag exerted by a financial system 
that will take longer to stabilize. Inflation rates are consequently expected to 
be lower than previously projected, and to dip below zero in some countries.
Global output is now projected to fall by 0.8 per cent in 2009, and to increase 
by a more modest 2.2 per cent in 2010—well below the rate of growth of 
global potential output (Table 1). Three important factors will help support 
the gradual recovery. First, economic activity in all major regions should be 
boosted by the strong and simultaneous monetary and fiscal policy actions 
that have been undertaken, which will raise aggregate demand and help to 
restore ­
consumer and business confidence. Second, as measures to stabilize 
the financial system begin to take hold, businesses and households should 
become less credit-constrained. Third, the drag exerted by the housing 
market correction in the United States and several other industrial countries 
should diminish, leading to a pickup in construction activity.

As anticipated in the January Update, the recovery in the United States will 
be much more muted than normal. Sustained positive growth will likely be 
deferred by one quarter compared with the Bank’s earlier projection, owing to 
the delayed implementation of stabilization measures in the banking sector. 
Annual GDP growth in the United States is projected to average -2.4 per cent 
in 2009 and 1.2 per cent in 2010, as diminished wealth, a weak labour market, 
tight credit conditions, and reduced confidence restrain growth in consump­
tion and ­
business investment. Activity is expected to stabilize in the second 
half of 2009 and to begin rising in early 2010, exceeding the growth rate of 
potential output and starting to take up excess capacity. Sales and produc­
tion of motor vehicles, which are currently well below replacement rates, are 
projected to rebound in the second half of 2009 but to levels significantly 
lower than their pre-crisis levels, as the auto sector continues to restructure. 
The housing sector, which has acted as a major drag on growth, should also 
finally stabilize in the second half of 2009 and contribute to the recovery.
The recovery in other industrial economies will be more delayed and more 
gradual than in the United States, owing to the less-ambitious policy actions 
undertaken so far and to ongoing difficulties in their banking systems. 
Completion of the inventory cycle in motor vehicles will lead to a gradual 
pickup in Asian and European auto production, while accelerating U.S.

growth will stimulate global economic activity through improved trade and 
financial flows, as well as rising confidence. Economic growth in China, in 
contrast, is expected to remain relatively robust, assisted by the introduc­
tion of additional fiscal and monetary stimulus measures to boost domestic 
demand and reduce the country’s reliance on exports. Economic conditions 
in other emerging-market economies are projected to improve gradually over 
this period, producing a synchronous boost in global demand and providing 
some support for commodity prices over the medium term. Energy prices 
are ­
assumed to move in line with current futures prices (Chart 5), while non-
energy prices are expected to strengthen gradually as economic activity 
recovers.

The Canadian Economy
In the January Update, the Bank projected a sharp recession in Canada, fol­
lowed by a relatively muted recovery starting in the third quarter of this year. 
As a result of the more severe, synchronized nature of the global downturn, 
the recession in Canada is even deeper than anticipated. As well, the Bank 
now expects the recovery to be delayed until the fourth quarter of 2009 and to 
be more gradual than projected in January. Nonetheless, the Bank is still pro­
jecting a rebound to above-potential growth in 2010, albeit with a lower esti­
mate of potential output growth. As explained in January, the recovery should 
be supported by a number of factors, including the timeliness and scale of 
the Bank’s monetary policy response; our relatively well-functioning financial 
system and the gradual improvement in financial conditions in Canada; the 
past depreciation of the Canadian dollar; stimulative fiscal policy measures; 
the gradual rebound in external demand; the strength of Canadian household, 
business, and bank balance sheets; and the end of the stock adjustments in 
Canadian and U.S. residential housing.
Recent Developments
Aggregate Demand and Supply
As a result of the sharper contraction in the global economy, economic growth 
in Canada has been much weaker than anticipated in the January Update. 
Export volumes fell sharply in the fourth quarter of 2008, led by dramatic 
declines in exports of motor vehicles and construction-related products to the 
United States. The terms of trade also plunged, causing real gross domestic 
income to register its largest quarterly decline on record (Chart 6). Canadian 
households reduced their spending by more than anticipated in response 
to the decline in their net worth and an elevated level of economic uncer­
tainty (Charts 7a and 7b). In total, the volume of final sales of goods declined 
by about 11 per cent (at annual rates) in the final quarter of 2008 (Chart 8).
1 
Given the surprising speed and magnitude of this decline, firms were slow 
to adjust production and therefore accumulated unwanted inventories. The 
stock-to-sales ratio rose to its highest level in more than a decade. Although 
this mitigated the decline in real GDP in the quarter, the 3.4 per cent (at annual 
rates) fall that was recorded was larger than the 2.3 per cent projected in the 
January Update. An inventory correction will therefore be needed, which will 
put additional downward pressure on growth this year.
The economic contraction in Canada intensified significantly in the first 
quarter of 2009. Exports of automotive products, forest products, and 
industrial materials posted further substantial declines. Firms have started 
to address their inventory problems, with widespread shutdowns in the

automotive sector in particular. Business investment is expected to register 
another steep decline in response to rising unused capacity and weak terms 
of trade.
Economy-wide, firms cut about 270,000 jobs in the first quarter and reduced 
the average work week. Deteriorating labour market conditions, combined 
with an additional decline in household net worth, are expected to cause 
further weakness in household spending. Government spending is the only 
component of demand expected to show positive growth in the quarter. 
Overall, real GDP is projected to drop at an annual rate of 7.3 per cent in the 
first quarter—the largest quarterly decline on record since 1961.
Recent developments are also adversely affecting the growth rate of poten­
tial output. Restructuring, especially in the automotive and forest products 
sectors, is expected to render some of the existing capital stock obsolete. 
The weaker profile for investment in this projection, relative to previous ones, 
should also contribute to dampening the growth of trend labour productivity. 
In light of these factors, the Bank has revised down its assumptions for the 
growth rate of potential output to 1.2 per cent in 2009, 1.5 per cent in 2010, 
and 1.9 per cent in 2011 (Technical Box 1).

2	 In the October 2008 Monetary Policy Report, the Bank had assumed the growth of potential output to be 2.4 per cent in 2009 
and 2.5 per cent in 2010 and 2011.
Given significant restructuring,  
assumptions for future growth of  
potential output have been lowered.

Technical Box 1
Revisions to Potential Output
Potential output is the level of goods and services that the economy can produce on a sustainable basis without 
adding to inflation pressures. The Bank’s measure of potential output is the product of trend labour productivity 
and trend labour supply. Trend labour productivity is related mainly to the amount of capital per worker and the 
pace of technological change. 
Significant structural changes are under way in the Canadian economy. These changes are most apparent in the 
automotive and forestry sectors but are occurring in other sectors as well.
1 Owing to their scale and abruptness, 
these changes will have an important effect on the current level of potential output and on its short-term growth 
rate. The closing of plants and other establishments will render a significant proportion of the capital stock obso­
lete. There will also be adjustment costs as labour is gradually redeployed to other activities. It is estimated that 
these developments will reduce the level of average labour productivity in the first half of 2009 and, hence, the 
level of potential output, 1.0 percentage point below what they would otherwise have been.
2
In addition, a significant downturn in investment, particularly for purchases of machinery and equipment, will 
moderate the increase in capital intensity and the adoption of new technology. This, in turn, will slow the growth 
of average labour productivity over the horizon in this report relative to the Bank’s previous assumptions.
Overall, potential output growth is expected to slow to 1.2 per cent in 2009 and then pick up gradually to 1.5 per 
cent in 2010 and to 1.9 per cent in 2011. Previously, potential output had been expected to increase by 2.4 per 
cent in 2009 and by 2.5 per cent in both 2010 and 2011.
The Bank will next review its estimates of potential output growth in its October 2009 Monetary Policy Report.
1	 The automotive and forestry sectors account for roughly 5.0 per cent of total output.
2	 While it is still too early to estimate the magnitude of these structural changes with precision, it is necessary to make an informed judgment, based on historical experience and currently 
available information, given the key role that potential output plays in the evolution of real economic activity and inflation pressures.

BANK OF CANADA    MONETARY POLICY REPORT    April 2009 13
Estimated Pressures on Capacity
Excess supply in the Canadian economy emerged at the end of 2008 and 
has expanded rapidly. The Bank’s conventional measure of the output gap 
suggests that the economy was operating about 3.5 per cent below its pro­
duction potential in the first quarter of 2009 (Chart 9). In the Bank’s spring 
Business Outlook Survey, the percentage of firms reporting that they would 
have difficulty meeting an unanticipated increase in demand fell to an excep­
tionally low level. Labour market indicators have started to reflect the down­
turn in the product market. This is particularly evident in the escalation of 
the unemployment rate between December and March to its highest level in 
seven years. The percentage of firms reporting labour shortages in the Bank’s 
spring survey fell to the lowest level in 10 years. In contrast, the 12-month 
change in the average hourly earnings of permanent workers, reported by 
Statistics Canada in the Labour Force Survey, has shown surprising strength 
since last autumn.
After reviewing all the indicators of capacity pressures, the Governing Council 
judges that the economy was operating about 3 per cent below its production 
capacity in the first quarter of 2009.
Inflation and the 2 Per Cent Target
Total CPI inflation has evolved largely as projected in the January Update 
with a slightly faster deceleration in the core rate of inflation being offset by 
a smaller decline in energy prices. The latter reflects larger-than-expected 
increases in the spreads between crude oil prices and gasoline prices. In 
March, the 12-month rate of increase in total CPI was 1.2 per cent, down from 
2.0 per cent in November (Chart 10).
The degree of excess supply increased 
markedly in the first quarter of 2009.
Total CPI inflation fell to 1.2 per cent 
in March while the core rate reached  
2.0 per cent.

The core rate of inflation reached 2.0 per cent in March, owing largely to a 
faster-than-expected deceleration in auto prices, which have been unusually 
volatile in recent months. Core food prices have continued to rise steeply, but 
this is not expected to persist, given the sharp drop in the prices of agricul­
tural commodities over the past year. With the rise in food prices decelerating 
and the substantial excess supply gap that has developed, both core and 
total inflation are poised to slow further over the next few months.
Reflecting the weakness in the economy and past declines in energy prices, 
measures of near-term inflation expectations have continued to fall in recent 
months. The latest Consensus Economics forecast for total CPI inflation is 
0.2 per cent for 2009. The forecast moves back up to 1.8 per cent for 2010, 
indicating that medium-term inflation expectations remain well anchored to 
the 2 per cent inflation target.
Canadian Credit Conditions
Financial conditions in Canada remain more favourable than in other 
advanced economies. The underlying strength of the balance sheets of 
Canadian financial institutions, corporations, and households has made the 
Canadian financial system better able to weather global storms. Nonetheless, 
conditions are noticeably tighter than normal, since the global crisis and its 
associated macroeconomic consequences have led to a widening of lending 
spreads in many markets and, in particular, a tightening of credit condi­
tions for corporations. Recently, there have been some signs of improve­
ment, although it is too soon to conclude that conditions will return quickly to 
normal.
Borrowing costs for banks decreased by about 95 basis points from mid-
January through mid-April, owing to the 100-basis-point reduction in the 
policy interest rate over that period (Chart 11). The reduction in bank funding 
costs has, to a significant extent, been passed on to households. The 
Medium-term inflation expectations 
remain close to the 2 per cent target.
Financial conditions in Canada remain

effective average nominal interest rate on household ­
borrowing has eased 
further since January to well below its level at the start of the financial turbu­
lence; it is also low by historical standards (Table 2). The growth of house­
hold credit remains surprisingly strong in light of the weakness of household 
spending; however, it has decelerated over the past six months (Chart 12), led 
by slower growth in residential mortgage credit, and is likely to slow further in 
the period ahead.
Canadian businesses are facing more difficult financing conditions. The 
pricing and availability of business credit, as reported in the Bank’s latest 
Senior Loan Officer Survey and Business Outlook Survey, tightened fur­
ther over the past three months (Chart 13). Credit spreads for both finan­
cial and non-financial issuers remain near record levels but have begun to 
narrow recently; with the continued decline in government yields, the level of 
­
borrowing rates has held relatively steady. Issuance by non-financial corpora­
tions is running at a higher level than in the same period last year, as investors 
have been attracted by the high spreads available on corporate bonds issued 
by good-quality borrowers, while corporations have taken advantage of the 
improved access to capital ­
markets to lock in longer-term funding.
The combined effects of various financial factors impinging on real economic 
activity are summarized in the financial conditions index (FCI), which weights 
a set of financial variables in proportion to their impact on real GDP. Such 
an index needs to be interpreted with ­
caution, given the inherent difficulty of 
quantifying the effects of changes in financial variables on the real economy 
and the short span of some of the data used. For this reason, changes in 
the FCI are likely to be more informative than its level. The index shows the 
marked deterioration of Canadian financial conditions in the final quarter of 
2008 to their tightest point in the past 10 years (Chart 14), as corporate bond 
rates and spreads rose in response to declining investor appetite for riskier 
assets. Since January, financial conditions have improved somewhat, as 
stock market gains and a lower overnight rate have partially offset continued 
The pricing and availability of business 
credit tightened further over the past 
three months.

Monetary aggregates continued to grow strongly, despite tight­
ening financial conditions and declining nominal GDP growth. This 
reflects an increase in money demand associated with low interest 
rates and portfolio shifts into more liquid assets. In the three months 
to February, the narrow aggregate M1+ grew at an annual rate of 
14.2 per cent, while M2++ grew by 9.9 per cent. It is difficult, though,

to draw the implications of this monetary expansion for economic activity, 
particularly since the demand for money is likely to shift even more than usual 
at low interest rates.
Exchange Rate
Since the January Update, the Canadian dollar has traded in a range of 77 to 
83 cents U.S., averaging about 80 cents U.S. (Chart 15). Recent support from 
strengthening oil prices has been largely offset by the weakening economy, 
leaving the Canadian dollar largely unchanged since the January Update.
Policy Response
Canadian fiscal and monetary policies have been eased substantially in 
response to the deteriorating macroeconomic situation, as part of the coordi­
nated global response. Significant additional fiscal and monetary stimulus has 
been provided since the January Update.
The federal budget announced on 27 January will deliver substantial fiscal 
stimulus over the 2009–10 period, and further stimulus is being provided by 
provincial budgets. The effects of this fiscal expansion will begin to be felt in 
the second half of 2009 and will build through next year.
Monetary policy was also eased significantly over this period, bringing the 
cumulative easing to 425 basis points since December 2007. The Bank of 
Canada lowered its target for the overnight interest rate by 50 basis points 
on 3 March and by a further 25 basis points on 21 April. The Bank judges the 
resulting level of the overnight rate, 25 basis points, to be the effective lower 
bound for that rate. Conditional on the inflation outlook, the Bank committed 
Canadian fiscal and monetary poli-
cies have been eased substantially in 
response to the deteriorating macro-
economic situation, as part of the 
coordinated global response.

to hold the target overnight rate at that level until the second quarter of 2010. 
It is the Bank’s judgment that this cumulative easing, together with the con­
ditional commitment, is the appropriate policy stance to move the economy 
back to full capacity and to achieve the 2 per cent inflation target.
Outlook for the Canadian Economy
The Bank’s base-case projection incorporates the following key assumptions: 
a Canada/U.S. exchange rate averaging 80 cents U.S.; energy prices in line 
with recent futures prices; prices for non-energy commodities increasing pro­
gressively as the global economy recovers; and tight global credit conditions 
persisting through mid-2010, before improving gradually.
Aggregate Demand and Supply
The Bank’s base-case projection now sees the Canadian economy contracting 
through to the third quarter of 2009 (one quarter longer than in the January 
Update), with real GDP dropping by 3.0 per cent this year on an annual 
average basis (Table 3). This is much weaker than anticipated in January, 
reflecting two main factors: foreign weakness propagating through trade, 
financial, and confidence channels, which has been more intense than previ­
ously projected; and delays in the implementation of policies (especially in the 
United States) to stabilize and recapitalize the global financial system, which 
have weighed on both financial conditions and confidence.

Export volumes are projected to fall significantly in the first half of 2009, 
reflecting the continued weakness in foreign demand for Canadian motor 
vehicles, industrial goods, and commodities.
Final domestic demand is expected to contract until the third quarter of 2009, 
owing to ­
persistent weakness in private domestic demand. The weakness in 
household spending is mainly due to lower expected real incomes, stemming 
from the deterioration in labour market conditions, weaker terms of trade, 
Canada’s real GDP is projected to fall 
by 3.0 per cent in 2009.
The Canadian Economy 
BANK OF CANADA    MONETARY POLICY REPORT    April 2009

and lower growth in potential output. Households have also experienced 
an ­
erosion in their wealth because of declines in equity and house prices. 
These factors, combined with heightened uncertainty about future incomes 
and asset prices, have led consumers to increase their desired savings rate. 
Resale activity in the housing market has slowed significantly, reflecting these 
developments. Investment in housing is expected to post outright decreases 
until late 2009.
Business fixed investment is expected to contract sharply in 2009, 
reflecting a drop in corporate profits, tight credit conditions, weak 
commodity prices, and the uncertain economic outlook. The pro­
jected decline in investment spending is consistent with the results of 
the Bank’s recent Business Outlook Survey and Statistics Canada’s 
Survey of Private and Public Investment Intentions. Firms also need to draw 
down their inventories, following the sharp buildup in recent months. Inventory 
decumulation is projected to subtract significantly from GDP growth during 
the first three quarters of this year.
Weak domestic demand in Canada is expected to lead to a large drop in 
import volumes in 2009, which more than offsets the weakness in sales 
abroad.
As in January, real GDP growth is projected to rebound to rates above that of 
potential output in the final quarter of 2009 (Chart 16). On an average annual 
basis, the economy is projected to grow by 2.5 per cent in 2010 and by 
4.7 per cent in 2011. A large part of the downward revision to growth in 2010 
is due to the lower assumed growth rate of potential output, relative to the 
January Update.
The anticipated normalization of financial conditions, together with the 
stimulus coming from monetary and fiscal policies, should restore consumer 
and business confidence and boost spending in 2010. As well, housing 
starts should gradually pick up, supported by historically low mortgage rates 
and demographic requirements of about 175,000 units per year. Exports 
Canada’s real GDP is projected to grow 
by 2.5 per cent in 2010 and 4.7 per cent 
in 2011.

are expected to recover in response to the gradual improvement in external 
demand and the past depreciation of the Canadian dollar.
The Canadian economy is projected to grow more rapidly than the U.S. 
economy in 2010 and 2011 for a number of reasons. The need for house­
holds to repair their balance sheets is smaller in Canada than in the United 
States, since wealth losses have been smaller (Chart 7a). The housing market 
­
correction is expected to be much less severe in Canada than in the United 
States. As well, Canadian exporters will benefit disproportionately from the 
recovery in the U.S. housing and automotive sectors, which will push the 
growth rate of U.S. demand for Canadian goods above the projected rate of 
growth of U.S. real GDP (Chart 17).
Owing to the near-term weakness in the growth of aggregate demand, excess 
supply in the Canadian economy continues to build, expanding in the second 
half of 2009 to about 4.5 per cent, roughly 0.75 percentage points larger 
than projected in the January Update. As the economy picks up in the fourth 
quarter and accelerates in 2010–11, excess supply is gradually absorbed, and 
the economy is expected to reach its productive capacity in the third quarter 
of 2011.
The Projection for Inflation
The development of substantial excess supply, together with a noticeable 
deceleration in food prices and modest decreases in house prices, should 
cause the core rate of inflation to diminish through 2009, reaching a trough of 
0.9 per cent in the fourth quarter (Table 4). This is slightly lower than expected 
in January, reflecting the wider output gap. With excess supply being 
absorbed gradually, and with inflation expectations well anchored, the core 
rate is projected to return to 2 per cent in the third quarter of 2011.
Both core and total CPI inflation are 
projected to return to 2 per cent in the 
third quarter of 2011.

As in January, total CPI inflation is expected to fall much more rapidly, dipping 
below zero in the second and third quarters of 2009, reflecting year-on-year 
drops in energy prices. The weaker profile for core inflation notwithstanding, 
the trough for total CPI inflation is not quite as low as in the January Update, 
reflecting the Bank’s assumption that recent margins between crude oil prices 
and gasoline prices will be maintained over the projection horizon. Total CPI 
inflation is also ­
expected to return to the Bank’s 2 per cent target in the third 
quarter of 2011.

Risks to the Outlook
BANK OF CANADA    MONETARY POLICY REPORT    April 2009 23
Risks to the Outlook
Global developments continue to pose significant risks to the Bank’s inflation 
projection for Canada, on both the upside and the downside. On the upside, 
confidence may return more rapidly than envisaged, if convincing action is 
taken more quickly than assumed to address financial system weaknesses 
in major economies. This could result in a stronger-than-projected recovery 
in the global economy as the aggressive and coordinated macroeconomic 
policy actions already being implemented take effect. On the downside, the 
global recession could be deeper and more protracted than envisaged if the 
resolution of these financial system problems is delayed further. More gener­
ally, there are risks around the resolution of global imbalances. While cyclical 
developments appear to be contributing to a narrowing of large current 
account imbalances, a lasting and orderly resolution will require policies to 
promote a rebalancing of domestic demand across major economic areas. In 
addition to these global risks, important uncertainties are associated with the 
difficult adjustments under way in certain sectors of the Canadian economy, 
notably energy and automotive.
The uncertainty regarding the effects of unconventional monetary policies, in 
the event that the recession turns out to be more protracted than expected, 
and the resulting need for prudence in the use of these instruments, imply that 
the risks to the Bank’s inflation projection are tilted slightly to the downside.
The Bank has attempted to quantify the uncertainties surrounding the inflation 
projection by using fan charts. Charts A and B in Technical Box 2 show the 
uncertainty around the projection for core and total CPI inflation. They show, 
in particular, the slight downward tilt to the confidence bands that results from 
monetary policy operating at the effective lower bound.
Risks to the Outlook

Technical Box 2
Fan Charts for Inflation
Economic projections are subject to considerable uncertainty. This can arise from different sources: the state 
of the economy, the nature of economic relationships, and the magnitude and persistence of ongoing shocks 
(Jenkins and Longworth 2002).
Confidence intervals presented as “fan charts” are an intuitive way of illustrating the uncertainty associated with 
an economic projection at various horizons. Charts A and B show 50 and 90 per cent confidence intervals for 
year-over-year core and total CPI inflation from the second quarter of 2009 to the end of 2011. The width of the 
confidence bands conveys the Bank’s best estimate of the uncertainty associated with the state of the economy 
and the magnitude and persistence of ongoing shocks.
1
The darkest region of Chart A at the end of 2009 ranges from 0.6 per cent  to 1.1 per cent for core CPI inflation 
and is referred to as a 50 per cent confidence interval. This means that the Bank projects a 50 per cent chance 
that year-over-year core CPI inflation will be between 0.6 per cent and 1.1 per cent. In addition, there is a 25 per 
cent chance (or probability) that the true value will be greater than 1.1 per cent, and a 25 per cent chance that it 
will be less than 0.6 per cent. The same principle applies to the lighter region, except that now the range is wider 
and, hence, our level of confidence is greater: 90 per cent. In this case, we can say that there is a 90 per cent 
chance that core CPI inflation will be between 0.2 per cent and 1.5 per cent at the end of 2009. In addition, we 
can say that we are 95 per cent certain that core inflation will be greater than 0.1 per cent in the second quarter 
of 2010.
2 Consequently, the Bank judges that the possibility of a period of sustained deflation in the Canadian 
economy remains remote.
Additional technical details on the construction of the fan charts are available at 
<http://www.bankofcanada.ca/en/mpr/pdf/backgrounder_fancharts.pdf>.
1	 More specifically, the width of the confidence bands over the first two quarters of the projection is based on the historical errors in the Bank’s projection over the 1995Q1 and 2008Q3 
­
period. The confidence bands beyond the first two quarters are based on the forecast errors from ToTEM, the Bank’s  projection model (Murchison and Rennison 2006). The uncertainty 
associated with the outlook for Canada’s main trading partners, which also influences the confidence intervals, is estimated using the forecast errors from a small model based on MUSE, 
the Bank’s model of the U.S. economy (Gosselin and Lalonde 2005).
2	 The second quarter of 2010 corresponds to the trough of the 90 per cent confidence interval for core CPI inflation.

annex - framework for conducting monetary policy at low interest rates
BANK OF CANADA    MONETARY POLICY REPORT    April 2009
The Objective of Monetary Policy
Low, stable, and predictable inflation is the best contribu­
tion that monetary policy can make to the economic and 
financial welfare of Canadians.
Under a joint agreement between the Bank of Canada 
and the Government of Canada, the objective of mon­
etary policy is to keep total CPI inflation at 2 per cent, the 
midpoint of a 1 to 3 per cent control range.
1
The Transmission Mechanism 
Normally, the Bank conducts monetary policy by setting 
a target for the overnight interest rate. Changes in the 
overnight rate influence longer-term market rates, as well 
as the interest rates set by financial institutions, which, in 
turn, affect aggregate demand and inflation.
2 With infla­
tion expectations well anchored at 2 per cent, the basic 
task is to keep the level of aggregate demand roughly in 
balance with the level of potential output.
Nominal interest rates cannot fall below zero. Therefore, 
when the overnight rate is close to zero, the Bank needs 
to consider alternative instruments that will provide addi­
tional stimulus to the economy, if required, to achieve 
its inflation objective. Even if the overnight rate is close 
to zero, longer-term market rates and the lending rates 
set by financial institutions are still likely to be well above 
zero. These interest rates directly affect the spending 
decisions of households and businesses. In these 
­
circumstances, the aim of monetary policy would be to 
continue to exert downward pressure on these rates and 
to improve the availability of credit more generally.
In principle, the Bank could lower the policy rate to zero. 
However, that would eliminate the incentive for lenders 
and borrowers to transact in markets, especially in the 
repo market. Therefore, to preserve the effective func­
tioning of markets in a low interest rate environment, the 
Bank is setting an effective lower bound (ELB) of 25 basis 
1	 The agreement can be found at <www.bankofcanada.ca/en/press/2006/pr06-18.html>.
2	 For a depiction of the transmission mechanism, see 
<www.bankofcanada.ca/en/monetary_mod/index.html>.
points for the overnight rate, and pegging the deposit rate 
at the target overnight rate.
3
Alternative Instruments Available 
at the Effective Lower Bound
The Bank has identified three main instruments that it 
would consider using to achieve its inflation objective at 
the ELB.
(i)	 Conditional statements about the future path of 
policy rates. Clear communication is a cornerstone 
of the Bank’s inflation-targeting framework and is a 
crucial factor behind its success. At the ELB, there are 
added benefits to increasing transparency through the 
use of an explicit conditional policy statement tied to 
the inflation outlook.
Because long-term interest rates on government 
securities represent averages of current and expected 
future short-term rates (plus term premiums), a cred­
ible conditional commitment by a central bank to keep 
short-term rates at the ELB for a longer period than 
previously expected by the market should lower bond 
yields throughout the term structure and, in turn, sup­
port the prices of other financial assets, as well as 
aggregate demand. If market expectations are already 
aligned with those of the central bank, these state­
ments would help to keep bond yields low. The Bank 
could also back up these statements with offers of 
longer-term purchase and resale agreements (PRAs) 
at rates consistent with its conditional commitment 
regarding the operating band. To ensure that market 
participants understand that the policy statements are 
conditional on the Bank’s inflation outlook and can 
assess the risks around the projection, such state­
ments would be supplemented with the publication 
of confidence intervals around the projection. This 
information should help shape market expectations of 
future short-term interest rates.
3	 The deposit rate, i.e., the interest paid on settlement balances (deposits) held at the Bank by 
direct participants in the Large Value Transfer System, is the lower limit of the operating band 
for the overnight rate. The deposit rate will provide an effective floor on the overnight rate 
because institutions will not have the incentive to lend at market rates below the deposit rate 
when they can earn that rate on balances held at the Bank. For a description of the framework 
for implementing monetary policy, see Engert, Gravelle, and Howard (2008). Some changes 
will occur to the operating band framework at the ELB. These are described in the press re­
lease of 21 April 2009 at <www.bankofcanada.ca/en/fixed-dates/2009/rate_210409.html>.

Monetary Policy 
at Low Interest Rates 
Annex 
26
annex - framework for conducting monetary policy at low interest rates 
BANK OF CANADA    MONETARY POLICY REPORT    April 2009
The other instruments that the Bank could use are more 
“unconventional,” involving outright purchases of assets. 
These purchases operate through changes in the com­
position, as well as the size, of the central bank balance 
sheet.
(ii)	Quantitative easing. Quantitative easing refers to 
outright purchases of financial assets through the 
creation of excess settlement balances (that is, central 
bank reserves). These asset purchases will push up 
the price of, and reduce the yield on, the purchased 
assets (which could include government securities 
or private assets).
4 The expansion of the amount of 
settlement balances available to direct participants 
in the Large Value Transfer System would encourage 
them to acquire assets or increase the supply of credit 
to households and businesses. This would increase 
the supply of deposits (or monetary aggregates) and 
further increase the demand for other financial assets, 
pushing their prices up and their yields down. Central 
bank purchases of treasury bills and short-term gov­
ernment bonds would also help reinforce the impact of 
the conditional statements about the future policy rate.
(iii)	Credit easing. Credit easing refers to ­
purchases of 
private sector assets in certain credit markets that are 
important to the functioning of the financial system but 
that are temporarily impaired. The objective of credit 
easing is to reduce risk premiums and improve liquidity 
and trading activity in these markets. This would, in 
turn, stimulate credit flows and aggregate demand. 
Credit easing does not need to be financed through an 
expansion of settlement balances. It could, instead, be 
financed either by reducing holdings of other assets or 
by increasing government deposit liabilities, so that the 
monetary base remains unchanged. In other words, the 
impact of credit easing on the level of settlement bal­
ances could be “sterilized” (Figure 1).
A number of factors will influence the relative effective­
ness of these instruments. The direct impact on the yield 
of the purchased asset will depend importantly on the 
degree of substitutability between asset classes (which 
may not be constant over time). The effect will be greater 
if the degree of substitutability is low. However, in that 
case, the pass-through from changes in the yields on 
the purchased assets to those on other asset classes in 
the economy is also likely to be low. If assets are highly 
substitutable, it will be more difficult to substantially affect 
their yields, but any given impact will be transmitted more 
broadly across asset classes.
4	 Although quantitative easing is now referred to as an unconventional monetary policy tool, 
the purchase of government securities is, in fact, the conventional textbook approach to 
monetary policy. A central bank can alter policy by changing either the quantity or the price of 
liquidity supplied to the financial system. In practice, most central banks have chosen to con­
duct monetary policy by targeting the price of liquidity because the relationships between the 
amount of liquidity provided by the central bank and monetary aggregates on the one hand, 
and between the monetary aggregates and aggregate demand and inflation on the other, are 
not very stable.
The macroeconomic impact of alternative actions will 
depend importantly on the degree of pass-through to 
the interest rates faced by households (since household 
spending represents a large share of the economy), the 
extent to which the intervention helps alleviate constraints 
in credit markets, and the response of the exchange rate 
to declines in yields on domestic securities. It will also 
depend on the extent to which financial institutions use 
the additional reserves to expand their supply of credit. 
Although a number of instruments are available to stimu­
late aggregate demand at the ELB, there is considerable 
uncertainty with respect to the size and timing of the 
economy’s response to these measures.
Principles Guiding Potential 
Bank of Canada Actions
The following principles will guide the Bank’s thinking in 
terms of which actions to undertake:
Focus 


on inflation target. The Bank would undertake 
transactions in the amounts and types that will have 
the desired effect in supporting aggregate demand 
and achieving the inflation target.
Impact. 


Asset purchases would be concentrated in 
the maturity range where they are expected to have 
the maximum impact on the economy. When con­
sidering transactions in private credit markets, the 
focus would be on those exhibiting a clear “market 
failure” (as evidenced, for example, by persistently 
excessive liquidity premiums) that has significant 
macroeconomic consequences through its impact on 
credit conditions and credit flows, and which central 
bank credit facilities or purchase programs can help 
alleviate.
Neutrality 


across sectors and across similar assets. 
To limit potential distortions, actions should be taken 
in as broad and neutral a fashion as possible. Markets 
in which purchases would occur should be defined as 
Unsterilized 
purchases 
of public 
sector debt 
Unsterilized 
purchases  
of private 
sector

broadly as possible. Operations should be conducted 
in a neutral fashion (e.g., through an auction).
Prudence. 


The Bank would take into account invest­
ment quality and would minimize operational risks. 
It would mitigate financial risks to its balance sheet, 
which could arise from changes in yields (valuation 
losses) or from the credit performance of private 
sector assets (credit losses).
The Bank would coordinate with the federal government 
to ensure that, together, measures taken to ease credit 
conditions and to stimulate the economy will achieve the 
best outcome. 
Key Indicators 
The Bank would closely monitor a number of indicators 
to assess the effectiveness of its policy measures. Most 
important will be the overall effect of any actions on the 
financing conditions faced by households and businesses 
and, thus, on aggregate demand and inflation.
Some indicators would be used to judge the direct impact 
of a particular instrument. For example, the effectiveness 
of conditional statements regarding the future policy rate 
can be judged by their observed impact on longer-term 
interest rates. The effectiveness of quantitative easing 
(or, alternatively, the gauge of required easing) would 
be judged in the first instance by the movement in the 
yield curve and more generally by movements in broader 
financial conditions, while that of credit easing would 
be judged by reductions in risky spreads and increased 
issuance activity. In assessing the effectiveness of any 
measures taken, the Bank would need to control for 
other factors that may have simultaneously affected the 
­
markets in question.
Results from the Business Outlook Survey and the Senior 
Loan Officer Survey would be very useful in assessing 
changes in the credit terms and conditions faced by 
firms. To provide summary indicators of financing condi­
tions, the Bank has constructed aggregate measures of 
borrowing costs and an overall financial conditions index 
for the economy.
5
The Bank would also monitor the evolution of credit and 
monetary aggregates. However, it is difficult to draw the 
implications of movements in monetary aggregates for 
total spending in the economy, since the demand for 
money and, hence, its velocity, are likely to shift even 
more than usual at very low interest rates.
The scale of the Bank’s interventions would be guided by 
what is prudently needed to achieve the desired improve­
ment in financial conditions.
5	 These measures are included on the Bank’s Credit Conditions web page at 
<http://credit.bankofcanada.ca>.
Exit Strategy
The exit strategy, or unwinding of the Bank’s various 
facilities and acquisition of assets, would be guided by 
the Bank’s assessment of conditions in credit markets 
and the inflation outlook.
A number of alternatives are available, including natural 
runoff through the maturing of the assets, the “refi­
nancing” of the acquired assets (e.g., financing in the 
repo market or allowing the runoff of other assets on the 
Bank’s balance sheet), and asset sales. In cases where 
assets need to be sold, the disposition of securities would 
be carried out at an appropriately measured pace.
Communications
Press releases on each fixed announcement date would 
remain focused on the target overnight rate and on the 
conditional statements about the future direction of policy 
rates.
The press release would also indicate any intention to 
carry out purchase programs and the approximate size 
of purchases (where relevant, given the program design) 
until the next announcement date or the one following. 
The Bank would explain the broad objectives of any 
­
purchases and how they are to be financed. Detailed 
operational decisions (such as pricing, specific timing, 
and exact securities eligible) would be communicated in 
­
separate announcements.
Press releases on fixed announcement dates and 
Monetary Policy Reports would provide an ongoing 
assessment of the economy and the outlook for infla­
tion, factoring in judgments regarding the effectiveness 
of the various policy measures. Speeches and parlia­
mentary appearances would provide additional venues 
for reporting on the details of the Bank’s conduct of 
­
monetary policy.
The Bank reserves its right to announce policy measures 
in the period between fixed announcement dates in 
exceptional circumstances.
