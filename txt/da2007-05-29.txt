The Bank of Canada today announced that it is maintaining its target for the
overnight rate at 4 1/4 per cent. The operating band for the overnight rate is
unchanged, and the Bank Rate remains at 4 1/2 per cent.
Information received since the April Monetary Policy Report (MPR) indicates that
economic growth and inflation in Canada in the first part of this year have been
stronger than the Bank was expecting. In April, both total CPI inflation, at 2.2 per
cent, and core inflation, at 2.5 per cent, were above expectations. On the basis of
available information, the Canadian economy is likely to have grown at an annual
rate of about 3 1/2 per cent in the first quarter of this year - a full percentage
point higher than was estimated in the MPR. The Bank now judges that there is
somewhat greater excess demand in the economy than was thought to be the
case in April. U.S. economic activity has come in largely as expected and
continuing robust growth outside North America has maintained the global
demand for, and high prices of, many commodities produced in Canada. Against
this overall backdrop, the Canadian dollar has risen appreciably above the range
assumed in the Bank's April projection.
On balance, the Bank judges that there is an increased risk that future inflation
will persist above the 2 per cent inflation target and that some increase in the
target for the overnight rate may be required in the near term to bring inflation
back to the target.
An updated analysis of the Bank's outlook for growth and inflation, including
economic and financial developments, trends, and risks, will be set out in the
Monetary Policy Report Update, to be published on 12 July 2007.
