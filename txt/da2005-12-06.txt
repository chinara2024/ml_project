Ottawa, Ontario
December 6, 2005
The Bank of Canada today announced that it is raising its target for the overnight
rate by one-quarter of one percentage point to 3 1/4 per cent. The operating band
for the overnight rate is correspondingly increased, and the Bank Rate is now
3 1/2 per cent.
Information received since the October Monetary Policy Report (MPR) indicates that
the Canadian and global economies have been evolving largely in line with the
Bank's expectations. In Canada, despite somewhat stronger than expected output
growth in the third quarter, the Bank expects the level of economic activity at the
end of 2005 to be about as projected in the MPR. Total CPI inflation, at 2.6 per cent
in October, has come down more quickly than expected, primarily reflecting a
rapid decline in gasoline prices. Core inflation, at 1.7 per cent in October, is in line
with the Bank's projection. Overall, the Bank's outlook for the economy and
inflation through 2006 and 2007 is broadly unchanged from October.
The Bank continues to judge that the risks to the outlook are balanced over the
short term, but are tilted to the downside through 2007 and beyond. In line with
the outlook, some further reduction in monetary stimulus will be required to
maintain a balance between aggregate supply and demand over the next four to
six quarters and keep inflation on target. The Bank will continue to monitor
international developments particularly closely and to assess the adjustments and
underlying trends in the Canadian economy, as well as the balance of risks, as it
conducts monetary policy to keep inflation on target over the medium term.
