Canada’s Inﬂ
 ation-Control Strategy1
Infl
 ation targeting and the economy
• The Bank’s mandate is to conduct monetary policy to pro-
mote the economic and ﬁ
 nancial well-being of Canadians . 
• Canada’s experience with infl
 ation targeting since 1991 
has shown that the best way to foster conﬁ
 dence in the 
value of money and to contribute to sustained economic 
growth, employment gains and improved living standards 
is by keeping infl
 ation low, stable and predictable . 
• In 2011, the Government and the Bank of Canada renewed 
Canada’s infl
 ation-control target for a further ﬁ
 ve-year 
period, ending 31 December 2016 . The target, as measured 
by the total consumer price index (CPI), remains at the 
2 per cent midpoint of the control range of 1 to 3 per cent .
The monetary policy instrument
• The Bank carries out monetary policy through changes 
in the target overnight rate of interest .2 These changes 
are transmitted to the economy through their infl
 uence 
on market interest rates, domestic asset prices and the 
exchange rate, which aﬀ
 ect total demand for Canadian 
goods and services . The balance between this demand 
and the economy’s production capacity is, over time, the 
primary determinant of infl
 ation pressures in the economy . 
• Monetary policy actions take time—usually from six to 
eight quarters—to work their way through the economy 
and have their full eﬀ
 ect on infl
 ation . For this reason, 
monetary policy must be forward looking . 
• Consistent with its commitment to clear, transparent 
communications, the Bank regularly reports its perspec-
tive on the forces at work on the economy and their 
implications for infl
 ation . The Monetary Policy Report is a 
key element of this approach . Policy decisions are typi-
cally announced on eight pre-set days during the year, 
and full updates of the Bank’s outlook, including risks to 
the projection, are published four times per year in the 
Monetary Policy Report .
Infl
 ation targeting is symmetric and ﬂ
 exible
• Canada’s infl
 ation-targeting approach is symmetric, which 
means that the Bank is equally concerned about infl
 ation 
rising above or falling below the 2 per cent target . 
• Canada’s infl
 ation-targeting framework is ﬂ
 exible . 
Typically, the Bank seeks to return infl
 ation to target over 
a horizon of six to eight quarters . However, the most 
appropriate horizon for returning infl
 ation to target will 
vary depending on the nature and persistence of the 
shocks buﬀ
 eting the economy .
Monitoring infl
 ation
• In the short run, a good deal of movement in the CPI is 
caused by fl
 uctuations in the prices of certain volatile 
components (e .g ., fruit and gasoline) and by changes in 
indirect taxes . For this reason, the Bank also monitors a 
set of “core” infl
 ation measures, most importantly the 
CPIX, which strips out eight of the most volatile CPI com-
ponents and the eﬀ
 ect of indirect taxes on the remaining 
components . These “core” measures allow the Bank to 
“look through” temporary price movements and focus on 
the underlying trend of infl
 ation . In this sense, core infl
 a-
tion is monitored as an operational guide to help the Bank 
achieve the total CPI infl
 ation target . It is not a replace-
ment for it .
1 See Joint Statement of the Government of Canada and the Bank of Canada on the Renewal of the Inﬂ
 ation-Control Target (8 November 2011) and
Renewal of the Inﬂ
 ation-Control Target: Background Information—November 2011, which are both available on the Bank’s website .
2 When interest rates are at the zero lower bound, additional monetary easing to achieve the infl
 ation target can be provided through three unconven-
tional instruments: (i) a conditional statement on the future path of the policy rate; (ii) quantitative easing; and (iii) credit easing . These instruments 
and the principles guiding their use are described in the Annex to the April 2009 Monetary Policy Report .

Global Economy
Global economic growth has evolved broadly as anticipated in the January 
Monetary Policy Report. In the United States, the expansion is continuing at 
a modest pace, with gradually strengthening private demand partly offset by 
accelerated fiscal consolidation. Significant policy easing has been introduced 
in Japan. The euro area remains in recession, however, and economic activity 
is being constrained by fiscal austerity, low confidence and tight credit condi­
tions. After picking up sharply in the second half of 2012, growth in China has 
eased. Commodity prices received by Canadian producers remain elevated 
by historical standards and, overall, they are little changed since the last Report.
Global economic activity is expected to grow modestly in 2013, at a rate of 
3.0 per cent, before strengthening to 3.6 per cent in 2014 and 3.8 per cent 
in 2015 (Table 1).1 The Bank’s base-case projection is predicated on the 
assumption that the crisis in the euro area will continue to be contained.
In response to significant excess capacity and declining inflationary pres­
sures, central banks in some advanced economies have provided additional, 
substantial unconventional monetary easing while keeping policy interest 
rates at historically low levels (Chart 1 and Chart 2). These actions have 
helped to anchor medium-term inflation expectations and support stimulative 
global financial conditions.
1	 As is customary in the April issue of the Monetary Policy Report, the projection horizon has been 
extended by one year, in this case, to 2015.

Global Financial Conditions
Global financial conditions have generally eased since the last Report as 
market participants have become more confident about the resilience of the 
global recovery. In particular, global tail risks associated with near-term U.S. 
fiscal policy have diminished. Markets are showing increased signs of dif­
ferentiating among individual countries and financial assets, as demon­
strated by the recent decline in co-movements in asset prices (Chart 3).

In the United States, financial conditions have remained highly stimulative. 
Monetary policy, combined with signs of strengthening private demand, has 
supported market confidence. While yields on long-term government bonds 
remain low, equity prices have reached record-high levels (Chart 4). 
Corporate credit markets continue to be robust, and yields have stabilized 
near recent record lows (Chart 5).
Financial conditions in Japan have improved further since the last 
Report, reflecting the unexpectedly bold monetary stimulus measures 
that were announced recently. Japanese equity prices have substantially

bond yields have fallen despite higher inflation expectations, and there has 
been a marked depreciation of the yen (Chart 6).
In the euro area, there has been a deterioration in market sentiment stemming 
from a number of factors, including weakening economic conditions, political 
uncertainty in Italy, the unsettling aspects of the financial assistance program

Portugal. Consequently, unlike other advanced economies, equity indexes in

conditions for Italy have deteriorated somewhat, owing to increased investor 
caution (Chart 7), there has been some differentiation among peripheral sover­
eigns. For example, yields on Irish bonds have fallen, reflecting progress 
toward fiscal adjustment and the implementation of structural reforms.
United States
Strengthening private domestic demand and a gradual firming in external 
conditions are expected to underpin the U.S. economic expansion, while 
fiscal consolidation and, to a diminishing extent, household deleveraging will 
continue to weigh on growth.
U.S. real GDP rose marginally in the fourth quarter of 2012, as solid 
underlying private demand was largely offset by outsized declines in some 
volatile components of spending. Real GDP growth is estimated to have 
rebounded in the first quarter, boosted by higher growth in consump­
tion, although the second quarter is projected to be weaker as fiscal drag 
intensifies. On a quarterly basis, economic growth is then expected to pick 
up to around 3.5 per cent by early 2014, before moderating over the bal­
ance of the projection horizon. On an annual average basis, growth in U.S. 
real GDP is expected to be 2.0 per cent in 2013, 3.1 per cent in 2014 and 
3.3 per cent in 2015.
Ongoing public sector deleveraging remains the strongest headwind facing the 
U.S. economy. The drag on U.S. real GDP growth from fiscal consolidation is 
expected to rise from 1.0 percentage point in 2012 to 1.8 percentage points in 
2013, before declining to 0.8 percentage points in 2014 (Chart 8). These esti­
mates include a revision to the timing of automatic spending cuts (known as 
“sequestration”).2 As a result, the drag from fiscal policy is now more front-
loaded than expected in the Bank’s January projection, although the cumula­
tive effect over the 2013−14 period has been revised down.
2	 These spending cuts, which were activated on 1 March 2013, mandate fiscal savings amounting to 
US$1.2 trillion over the next nine years.

BANK OF CANADA  •  Monetary Policy Report  •  April 2013
In light of the constraining effects of fiscal consolidation and private delever­
aging, monetary policy is projected to remain highly stimulative through 
2015. Consistent with guidance provided by the Federal Open Market 
Committee, the federal funds rate is expected to stay at exceptionally low 
levels, for at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 
6.5 per cent, projected inflation one and two years out is no more than 
2.5 per cent, and longer-term inflation expectations continue to be well 
anchored. To provide further policy accommodation, the Federal Reserve is 
also expected to continue to purchase agency mortgage-backed securities 
and longer-term U.S. Treasuries.
Consumer spending has been solid since the beginning of 2013, although it 
is being affected by the 2 per cent rise in payroll taxes that took effect in 
January. Consumption is projected to be supported by rising labour income, 
low debt-financing costs and better access to credit. In addition, the drag 
from household deleveraging is expected to diminish over the projection 
horizon, given the considerable progress households have made in repairing 
their balance sheets (Chart 9).
The recovery in the housing market continues to gain traction (Box 1). 
Housing starts, sales of new and existing homes, and builder and realtor 
sentiment have all improved noticeably. Importantly, house prices have 
started to increase after five years of declines (Chart 10). Residential con­
struction should continue to grow at a solid pace, underpinned by gradually 
improving labour market conditions, underlying demographic demand, low 
mortgage interest rates and an expected improvement in access to credit.
Fundamentals for business fixed investment remain quite favourable. U.S. 
corporations have strong balance sheets and can obtain market financing at 
a very low cost. Following some volatility at the turn of the year caused by 
uncertainty related to the impending fiscal cliff, business investment is now

anticipated to grow at a robust pace. Non-residential construction is also 
expected to recover, reflecting buoyant investment activity in the U.S. oil and 
gas sector (Chart 11) as well as a gradual improvement in the commercial 
real estate sector.
Firming foreign demand is projected to support a steady rise in U.S. exports 
through 2015, while stronger domestic demand should stimulate the growth 
of imports. Oil imports, however, especially of light crude, are expected to 
be increasingly displaced by growing U.S. production.3
3	 In the United States, oil production reached nearly 6.5 million barrels per day in 2012, while net imports 
of crude oil fell to 8.4 million barrels per day, the lowest level in 15 years. The U.S. Energy Information 
Administration expects U.S. oil production to increase to close to 8 million barrels per day in 2014.

Recovery in U.S. Housing to Support the Canadian Economy
The contraction in the U .S . housing market from 2006 
to 2011 was the most pronounced and prolonged in the 
postwar era (Chart 1-A) . Residential investment declined 
by almost 60 per cent, and house prices fell by about 35 per 
cent from their pre-crisis highs . Over the past year, residen-
tial investment increased by 15 per cent and house prices by 
10 per cent, suggesting that a durable recovery in the U .S . 
housing market is ﬁ
 nally under way .
It will take time, however, for residential investment to 
return to a more normal level . Currently, the share of resi-
dential investment in GDP stands at only 2 .6 per cent, about 
half its historical average before the crisis . The Bank’s base-
case projection calls for a continued, gradual recovery in 
U .S . residential investment . This recovery, combined with 
the positive spillovers to related industries (e .g ., appliances 
and furniture) and the boost to household wealth, will make 
a signiﬁ
 cant contribution to U .S . real GDP growth over the 
2013–15 period .
The U .S . housing recovery is delivering important beneﬁ
 ts to 
the Canadian economy . The Bank projects that U .S . residen-
tial investment will grow at an average annual rate of about 
12 .5 per cent over the 2013–15 period which, all else equal, 
would be expected to boost Canadian export growth by an 
average of roughly 1 percentage point per year based on 
historical relationships . The higher income and wealth in the 
United States generated by the housing recovery will also 
lead to higher U .S . consumption, further raising demand for 
Canadian exports .
The most direct beneﬁ
 ts to Canada will be felt by the 
forestry sector and other construction-related exports . 
Canadian lumber production fell sharply in 2006 as U .S . 
housing starts dropped, and while Canada was able to 
diversify somewhat into diﬀ
 erent markets—most notably 
China—this was not enough to oﬀ
 set the drop in U .S . 
demand (Chart 1-B) . The stronger demand in the U .S . 
housing sector over the past year has led to a 55 per cent 
increase in lumber prices, which reached their highest level 
since April 2005 . These higher prices have resulted in a 
terms-of-trade improvement for Canada as a net exporter 
of lumber, increasing Canadians’ purchasing power and 
pushing up proﬁ
 ts, ultimately stimulating production, 
employment, investment and wages in the forestry sector .1 
Given existing capacity, along with the eﬃ
  ciency- 
enhancing 
restructuring that has taken place within the forestry sector 
in recent years, Canadian producers are well positioned to 
respond in a timely manner .

U.S. inflationary pressures remain weak. The price index for core personal 
consumption expenditures has risen at an annual rate of only 1.1 per cent over 
the past three months, although medium-term inflation expectations continue 
to be well anchored. A modest rise in U.S. inflation is anticipated over the 
projection horizon, however, as the excess supply gap is gradually reduced.
Euro Area
Real GDP in the euro area decreased at an annual rate of 2.3 per cent in 
the fourth quarter of 2012, the largest drop since the 2008−09 recession. 
Germany’s real GDP declined by 2.4 per cent owing to weak investment and 
exports, particularly exports to the United States. As well, activity in many 
peripheral economies continued to contract, dampened by the negative 
effects of fiscal austerity, low confidence and tight credit conditions. The 
transmission of monetary policy to the peripheral countries remains impaired, 
with market segmentation leading to persistently high bank lending rates, 
especially for small and medium-sized corporations (Chart 12).
Economic activity in the euro area is expected to decline further during the 
first half of 2013, although at a slower pace (Chart 13). A gradual recovery, 
initially supported by external demand, should then take hold. Domestic 
demand is not expected to become a significant driver of economic growth 
until late 2014, when the negative effects of tight lending conditions and 
fiscal consolidation begin to dissipate. On an average annual basis, real 
GDP in the euro area is expected to decline by 0.6 per cent in 2013, before 
rising by 0.8 per cent in 2014 and 1.4 per cent in 2015. Significant differ­
ences in the economic conditions of the core and peripheral economies are 
expected to persist. Relative to expectations at the time of the January 
Report, the outlook for the euro area has been revised downward.
Headline CPI inflation in the euro area has eased in recent months, falling 
to 1.7 per cent on a year-over-year basis in March. The decline occurred 
despite the impact of increases in indirect taxes, which is estimated to have 
added up to 0.4 percentage points. Given the large excess supply gap, infla­
tion is expected to decline further over the projection horizon.

Although the crisis in the euro area remains contained, the financial crisis 
in Cyprus and political uncertainty in Italy highlight ongoing vulnerabilities. 
To move the euro area onto a more sustainable growth trajectory, structural 
reforms to enhance competitiveness and further progress toward a banking 
union, as well as fiscal integration, will be needed.

Real GDP in Japan grew by 0.2 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2012, fol­

more significant policy measures, including additional fiscal stimulus.4 Most 
importantly, the Bank of Japan has moved to a 2 per cent inflation target 
and has recently announced a number of bold new measures designed to 
achieve this goal within two years—almost doubling the monetary base to 
¥270 trillion (or 54 per cent of GDP) by the end of 2014, primarily through the 
purchase of longer-term Japanese government bonds.
This substantial policy easing will help boost the growth of domestic 
demand in Japan over the projection horizon. The recent sharp depreciation 
of the yen, coupled with an increase in external demand, is also expected to 
spur a significant rebound in exports. However, planned increases in the 
value-added tax in 2014 and 2015 may dampen growth somewhat.5 Prospects 
for economic growth in Japan have been revised upward since the January 
Report, as the positive effect of more accommodative monetary policy more 
than offsets the negative influence of a downward revision to the Bank’s view 
on Japan’s potential output growth.6
Emerging-Market Economies
Real GDP growth in China slowed in the first quarter, following a pickup to 
very strong growth rates in the second half of 2012. Ongoing momentum 
in the residential real estate sector and renewed increases in home prices 
have raised concerns about imbalances in the sector, prompting Chinese 
policy-makers to introduce additional measures to limit housing demand 
(Chart 14).7
China’s real GDP growth is expected to stabilize in a range between 
7.5 per cent and 8 per cent over the next three years, reflecting policy actions 
taken to dampen the buildup of domestic imbalances. Growth in investment 
spending is projected to slow gradually, as public infrastructure investment 
moderates and the housing sector stabilizes in response to the new, more 
restrictive policy measures. In contrast, the growth of consumer spending is 
expected to gain momentum, fuelled by solid increases in wages and employ­
ment, as well as ongoing structural reforms. A rebound in exports is also antici­
pated, consistent with improving demand in advanced economies, but will likely 
be tempered by a projected appreciation in the real value of the renminbi.
Economic activity has picked up in several other emerging-market economies 
(EMEs). While the improvement has been most pronounced in emerging Asia 
and parts of Latin America, there are sizable differences in economic condi­
tions across and within regions. Growth in Mexico continues to be relatively 
strong, and economic growth in Brazil has firmed, although it remains below 
potential. An exception in emerging Asia has been India, where growth has 
slowed because of reductions in government spending, a disappointing 
summer harvest and ongoing supply-side constraints. Overall, economic 
activity in EMEs is projected to strengthen over the projection horizon, sup­
ported by continued policy stimulus and increasing external demand.
4	 The Japanese government announced a supplementary budget in January 2013, with additional 
stimulus totalling ¥13.1 trillion, or 2.8 per cent of GDP. The effects of these measures were incorporated 
into the Bank’s January base-case projection.
5	 Subject to the strength of economic conditions, Japan’s value-added tax will increase from 5 per cent 
to 8 per cent in April 2014 and to 10 per cent in October 2015.
6	 The projected growth of potential output in Japan has been lowered, following a reassessment of the 
impact of the declining labour force.
7	 These measures include a 20 per cent tax on capital gains on property transactions, as well as an 
increase in the down payment requirement and higher mortgage rates for homebuyers purchasing a 
second apartment in cities where housing prices are rising quickly.

Commodity Prices
Commodity prices remain high by historical standards (Box 2). Modest global 
demand and increased supply, however, have led to a 14 per cent decline in 
the Bank of Canada’s commodity price index (BCPI) from its most recent peak 
in April 2011.8 The BCPI is little changed since the January Report (Chart 15), 
as higher prices for Western Canada Select (WCS) crude oil, natural gas and 
lumber have been offset by declines in other components.
The Bank’s crude oil price index is up about 7 per cent since the January 
Report, supported by the recovery in the price of WCS, which has jumped 
to US$80 per barrel from a recent low of US$55 per barrel in December. 
However, other benchmark prices for oil, such as Brent and West Texas 
Intermediate (WTI), have decreased. The rebound in the price for WCS is 
related to both increased use of rail transportation and a temporary reduc­
tion in production, which have eased constraints caused by insufficient 
pipeline capacity. As a result, the spread between WTI and WCS prices has 
returned closer to its historical norm of about US$15 per barrel.
Based on the latest futures curves, Brent and WTI prices are expected to 
decline slightly over the projection horizon, and the spread between these 
benchmark prices is anticipated to narrow modestly (Chart 16). The gap 
between WTI and WCS prices is expected to widen somewhat, in response 
to an increase in Canadian production.
Natural gas prices have continued to rise in recent months, increasing by 
about 20 per cent since the January Report. At US$4.20 per million BTU, 
however, prices remain well below the average level of US$5.60 recorded 
over the past ten years. According to the latest futures curve, natural gas 
prices are expected to increase steadily, reaching US$4.50 per million BTU 
by the end of 2015.
Prices for non-energy commodities have fallen by about 4 per cent since the 
last Report. Base metals prices have been on a declining trend since 2011, 
in line with slowing global economic growth, notably in China. Slower 
growth in demand, combined with increased supply, has led to a marked

buildup of inventories. As a result, base metals prices are expected to 
remain weak over the near term, before firming modestly with the projected 
strengthening in global activity. Lumber prices are expected to continue 
rising in coming years, albeit at a more modest pace, since the impact of 
increased demand for lumber from the U.S. housing sector will be partly 
offset by expanding supply. Prices for agricultural products are somewhat 
lower than in January and are expected to decrease further over the projec­
tion horizon, as crop yields rebound from drought-reduced levels.

Commodity Prices Remain Elevated 
In recent years, commodity prices have been elevated and, 
at times, highly volatile . Currently, the Bank of Canada’s 
commodity price index in infl
 ation-adjusted terms (real 
BCPI) remains elevated relative to its historical average 
(Chart 2-A), largely as a result of higher prices for crude oil 
(Table 2-A) .1 
Commodity prices are not, however, as elevated as 
they were two years ago . Real prices for crude oil and 
base metals have declined 20 per cent and 28 per cent, 
respectively, since early 2011, mainly refl
 ecting the impact 
of increased supply and slower-than-expected global 
economic growth (especially in China, one of the world’s 
largest consumers of industrial commodities) (Chart 2-B) . 
Oil prices remain very elevated despite the recent decline . 
Base metals prices, however, are now close to their long-run 
average .2 Natural gas prices have fallen by 17 per cent over 
the past two years to a level below their historical average, 
as a result of the remarkable supply growth in shale gas in 
the United States . In contrast, lumber prices have soared 
by close to 55 per cent since early 2012, beneﬁ
 ting from the 
recovery in the U .S . housing market, and have moved back 
in line with their historical average .
Since the January Report, prices for the commodities pro-
duced in Canada have generally increased . Most notably, 
prices for Western Canada Select (WCS), an important

benchmark for Canadian oil producers and exporters, have 
risen by 32 per cent . However, this follows a similarly sharp 
decline in WCS prices through late 2012 . These large price 
swings are consistent with the elevated volatility in this 
benchmark compared with global crude oil prices seen in 
recent years (Chart 2-C) .

Implications for the Canadian Economy
Demand for Canada’s non-commodity exports remains well below its pre-
recession peak. The foreign activity measure has regained only 70 per cent 
of the decline registered during the 2008−09 recession, largely reflecting the 
still-low level of activity in the U.S. housing sector.9 Nevertheless, demand 
for Canadian exports is expected to grow solidly over the projection horizon, 
mainly underpinned by the continued recovery in the U.S. housing market 
and robust growth in U.S. business investment. Notably, growing production 
of light crude oil in the United States is not expected to have a significant 
impact on Canadian exports of heavy crude. Commodity prices, which, in 
aggregate, are still at historically high levels, should continue to support 
Canada’s terms of trade and gross domestic income.
Canadian Dollar
The Canadian dollar has averaged 98 cents U.S. since the March fixed 
announcement date, compared with the 101 cents U.S. assumed in January 
(Chart 17). It is assumed to remain at 98 cents U.S. over the projection horizon.
9	 The foreign activity measure captures the composition of foreign demand for Canadian exports by 
weighting the various components of U.S. private final domestic demand and economic activity in other 
countries according to their importance for Canada’s external trade.

The Canadian dollar is assumed 
to remain at 98 cents U.S.
The relatively higher volatility of WCS prices refl
 ects the 
lower market liquidity for WCS . This is essentially an over-
the-counter cash market for physical delivery; hence, prices 
respond more quickly and strongly to issues related to 
transportation and infrastructure . Moreover, in recent years, 
the combination of robust production growth and limited 
progress in expanding transportation capacity has led to 
more frequent bottlenecks in the delivery of crude oil from 
Western Canada to market .3 As a result, WCS prices are 
expected to remain volatile until suﬃ
  cient transportation 
capacity is in place . This volatility adds to the uncertainty 
facing Canada’s energy sector, which is expected to remain 
a factor restraining Canadian business investment .

Their Impact on the Economy,” in the January 2013 Report.

Canadian Economy
Following a weak second half of 2012, economic growth in Canada is pro­
jected to regain some momentum through 2013 as net exports pick up and 
business fixed investment returns to more solid growth (Chart 18). Consumer 
spending is expected to grow at a moderate pace over the projection 
horizon, while residential investment declines further from historically high 
levels. Growth in total household credit has slowed and the Bank continues 
to expect that the household debt-to-income ratio will stabilize near current 
levels. Despite the projected recovery in exports, they are likely to remain 
below their pre-recession peak until the second half of 2014, owing to 
restrained foreign demand and ongoing competitiveness challenges, 
including the persistent strength of the Canadian dollar.
The outlook for the Canadian economy is slightly weaker than forecast in the 
January Report, with government spending now assumed to make an even 
smaller contribution to real GDP growth. Business investment growth is also 
projected to be somewhat weaker, reflecting ongoing challenges in the 
resource sector and firms’ broader concerns regarding the strength of 
global and domestic demand. As a result, the Bank now sees the Canadian 
economy returning to full capacity only in mid-2015.

BANK OF CANADA  •  Monetary Policy Report  •  April 2013
Total and core CPI inflation have remained low in recent months, broadly in 
line with expectations in the January Report, although there has been 
considerable monthly volatility. Both inflation measures are projected to 
remain well below 2 per cent in coming quarters, reflecting the material 
slack in the economy, heightened competitive pressures in the retail 
sector, and some special factors such as slower increases in regulated 
prices and the pass-through of previous declines in agricultural prices to 
consumer prices. As the economy returns to full capacity, and with infla­
tion expectations well anchored, inflation is projected to rise gradually to 
the 2 per cent target by mid-2015.
Financial Conditions
Reflecting in part the considerable monetary policy accommodation in 
place, the supply and price of credit for businesses and households in 
Canada remain very stimulative (Chart 19), continuing to provide important 
support to the economic expansion.
Canadian debt markets have generally remained strong in recent months. 
Yields on corporate bonds have edged down from their already exception­
ally low levels, reflecting both a decline in yields on Canadian government 
bonds and a further narrowing in credit spreads. Canadian equity markets, 
however, have underperformed equity markets in some other advanced 
economies since the January Report.
Additional evidence that credit conditions for Canadian firms continue to be 
very stimulative is provided by the responses of firms surveyed in the Bank’s 
spring Business Outlook Survey (available on the Bank’s website under 
Publications and Research > Periodicals > BOS Spring 2013) and those of 
financial institutions surveyed in the latest Senior Loan Officer Survey (avail­
able on the Bank’s website under Publications and Research > Periodicals 
> SLOS 2013Q1). Responses to these surveys indicate that, on balance, 
borrowing conditions are little changed since last autumn, following a period 
of almost uninterrupted easing since late 2009 (Chart 20). Nonetheless, 
some tightening has been reported for smaller firms in the resource sector.

The favourable lending conditions offered to Canadian firms by financial 
institutions partly reflect the ongoing access by Canadian banks to low-cost 
funding across the term structure in both Canadian and foreign currencies.
The growth of total business credit has remained well above its historical 
average, stimulated by the highly advantageous financing conditions 
(Chart 21). Some moderation has been seen in recent months, however, 
partly reflecting the unwinding of transitory factors. In particular, bond issu­
ance by non-financial corporations has slowed following rapid growth in the

fourth quarter of 2012 (Chart 22), which was boosted by the early refinan­
cing of corporate debt at favourable interest rate levels, according to 
industry consultations. In spite of the recent slowing, total business credit is 
still growing considerably faster than business investment.
As expected, growth in total household credit has continued to moderate 
despite near-record-low borrowing rates (Chart 23). The cumulative effects 
of changes to mortgage insurance rules and the tightening of mortgage 
underwriting guidelines, an increasing appreciation among consumers of 
the risks associated with elevated debt levels, and the tightening bias of the 
Bank of Canada have all contributed to this moderation. With household 
credit growth slowing to a pace close to that of disposable income in the 
fourth quarter, the aggregate household debt-to-income ratio remained 
roughly unchanged from the previous quarter at 165 per cent. The Bank 
continues to anticipate that the debt-to-income ratio will stabilize near 
current levels.

BANK OF CANADA  •  Monetary Policy Report  •  April 2013
Growth in the narrow monetary aggregates has picked up noticeably since 
the beginning of the year, coincident with other indicators that suggest a 
firming in GDP growth. Growth in the broad monetary aggregates has also 
increased over the same period, largely owing to the contribution from 
narrow money. Nonetheless, the overall trend in broad money remains con­
sistent with subdued inflationary pressures ahead.
Estimated Pressures on Capacity
Output-related indicators suggest that a material degree of slack has re-
emerged in the Canadian economy, as real GDP expanded at a rate below 
that of the economy’s production potential throughout 2012. Real GDP grew 
by 0.6 per cent (at annual rates) in the fourth quarter, with solid advances 
across most domestic components of GDP offset by an unexpectedly large 
reduction in inventory investment. The Bank estimates that real GDP growth 
picked up to 1.5 per cent in the first quarter of 2013, driven primarily by a 
stabilization in inventory investment as well as higher exports, which in turn 
were supported by improved global demand and the passing of the tem­
porary factors that restrained activity in the energy sector through the second 
half of 2012. These rates of growth in output are slightly weaker than had been 
anticipated in the January Report, leaving the level of real GDP in the first 
quarter of 2013 0.3 per cent below the level expected at that time. Consistent 
with these dynamics, the Bank’s conventional measure of the output gap 
widened slightly to -1.2 per cent in the first quarter of 2013 (Chart 24).
On balance, responses to the Bank’s spring Business Outlook Survey also 
indicate a material degree of slack in the Canadian economy (Chart 24). 
The proportion of firms that would have difficulty meeting an unexpected 
increase in demand remains below the level seen over much of the past two

Labour market indicators more generally continue to suggest the persis­

employment data have been volatile, the unemployment rate declined to an 
average of 7.1 per cent in the first quarter, the lowest rate since the end of 
2008. However, the average duration of unemployment and the proportion 
of involuntary part-time workers remain at elevated levels. In addition, wage 
growth has moderated in recent quarters (Chart 26).

On balance, the Bank judges that the economy was operating about 
1¼ per cent below its production capacity in the first quarter of 2013, 
a slightly larger degree of slack than expected in the January Report.
The Real Economy
The Bank continues to forecast a pickup in real GDP growth through 2013 
(Chart 27) and some rebalancing of aggregate demand in Canada. With 
external demand projected to grow solidly and some of the challenges in the 
resource sector expected to be addressed over time, the contributions to 
growth from net exports and business fixed investment are forecast to 
increase (Chart 18 and Table 2). Growth in household spending is projected 
to be relatively modest, reflecting continued moderate increases in

consumption and further declines in residential investment. The contribution 
of government spending to GDP is expected to remain at levels well below 
its historical average.
On a quarterly basis, economic growth in Canada is expected to rise from 
the 1.5 per cent estimated for the first quarter of 2013 to 2.5 per cent in 
the second half of 2013 and 3.0 per cent in the first half of 2014 (Table 3). 
Despite this expected pickup, the weak output growth through the second 
half of 2012 causes real GDP growth on an annual average basis to dip 
to 1.5 per cent in 2013 from 1.8 per cent in 2012. The economy is then 
expected to grow by 2.8 per cent in 2014 and by 2.7 per cent in 2015, well 
above the estimated growth of potential output.
The level of economic activity over the projection horizon is somewhat lower 
than in the January Report. This reflects downward revisions to growth in 
government spending, in line with the latest budget announcements from all 
levels of government. It also reflects a slightly lower profile for business fixed 
investment, owing to firms’ heightened concerns regarding the strength of 
demand as well as volatility in the prices received by Canadian oil 
producers.
Household spending has evolved broadly as expected in recent quarters. 
Consumption has risen at about the same pace as disposable income, 
holding the savings rate roughly stable at slightly below 4 per cent and con­
tinuing to restrain the need for consumer credit. At the same time, residen­
tial investment has declined further from historically high levels, owing to 
lower rates of new construction. Housing starts dropped markedly in the 
first quarter to an average of about 177,000 units, after remaining above 
demographic demand (estimated at roughly 185,000 units) over the past two 
years. Despite the recent moderation in the rate of new housing construc­
tion, there are still signs of overbuilding, particularly of multiple-unit dwell­
ings in some urban areas (Chart 28). The resale housing market has shown 
some signs of stabilization in recent months, following the easing in both 
activity and prices from the high levels reached between the latter part of 
2011 and early 2012. Still, valuations in some segments of the housing 
market remain stretched.
Contributions to growth from 
net exports and business fixed 
investment are forecast to 
increase
The level of economic activity 
over the projection horizon is 
somewhat lower than in the 
January Report

in the rate of new housing

BANK OF CANADA  •  Monetary Policy Report  •  April 2013
As in the January Report, the outlook for household spending reflects some 
ongoing restraint by Canadian households related to high levels of debt. 
Consumption is still expected to grow at a moderate rate over the projection 
horizon, in line with the growth of disposable income (Chart 29). Residential 
investment is anticipated to decline further as overbuilding begins to be 
addressed, contributing to a more sustainable path for the housing sector. In 
this regard, the share of residential investment in the overall economy is 
projected to decline toward its historical average (Chart 30).
The Bank expects growth in business fixed investment to return to a more 
solid pace through 2013 (Chart 31) after slowing through the second half of 
2012 (Box 3). This slowdown, which was concentrated in the resource 
sector, appears to have reflected both sector-specific challenges and more 
general concerns about the outlook for global and domestic demand. The 
Consumption is still expected to 
grow at a moderate rate, in line 
with the growth of disposable 
income
The Bank expects growth in 
business fixed investment to 
return to a more solid pace 
through 2013…

Box 3
Factors Weighing on the Outlook for Business Investment
After picking up strongly during the recovery, business 
investment slowed unexpectedly in the second half of 2012 . 
Over the same period, responses to the Bank’s Business 
Outlook Survey began to indicate that  
concerns about 
demand were weighing on ﬁ
 rms’ expectations for business 
activity . In the most recent survey, many ﬁ
 rms reported 
that uncertainty is leading them to postpone some invest-
ment projects or to favour investments with smaller capital 
outlays, shorter payback periods or less risk, or to shift 
their investment spending toward new or diﬀ
 erent seg-
ments of demand . The source of the uncertainty weighing 
on investment plans was most often related to demand or 
sector-speciﬁ
 c conditions (Chart 3-A) .
According to Statistics Canada’s survey on private and 
public investment intentions, plans for private capital 
spending for 2013 registered their smallest increase since 
2009 . Investment intentions weakened in several sectors, 
including manufacturing, although much of the overall 
weakness came from the mining and oil and gas extraction 
sectors, where investment intentions are no longer growing 
(Chart 3-B) . These sectors led investment activity earlier in 
the recovery and together account for 35 per cent of busi-
ness investment in Canada . Recent pressures on investment 
intentions in these sectors are described below .
Oil and gas
lower prices for Western canada Select (WcS), coupled 
with historically low prices for natural gas and heightened 
uncertainty about the global economic outlook, contributed 
to a marked slowdown in engineering investment in Canada 
in the second half of 2012 . In Western Canada, drilling 
activity was less buoyant as ﬁrms dealt with lower prices and 
cash fl
 ows, and junior and intermediate producers experi-
enced challenges accessing capital markets . In addition, 
concerns about the likelihood and timing of major pipeline 
projects, together with the rapid increase in the production of 
light oil in the United States, have led to uncertainty around 
pricing and market access going forward . This uncertainty 
persists and, notwithstanding the strengthening of WCS 
prices in recent months, is tempering investment intentions 
for 2013–14 as some ﬁ
 rms are re-evaluating their projects .
Mining
Following an intense period of exploration and large invest-
ments in the mining sector, the price proﬁ
 le for several 
metals extracted in Canada has weakened amid sluggish 
global demand and growing world supply . Many mining ﬁ
 rms 
have shifted to lower-cost projects that pose less risk in this 
environment . At the same time, higher construction and 
operating costs have provided strong incentives to invest to 
improve eﬃ
  ciency . As with oil and gas, junior mining com-
panies have faced diﬃ
  cult capital market conditions, and 
many are re-evaluating their exploration programs to shut 
down or divest their high-cost, non-core assets .

BANK OF CANADA  •  Monetary Policy Report  •  April 2013
projection for more solid investment growth continues to be supported by 
the healthy aggregate financial position of Canadian firms, favourable credit 
conditions and the strong Canadian dollar, as well as the impetus to improve 
productivity amid heightened pressures to become more competitive. 
However, there are signs that the factors that have recently been weighing 
on investment growth are likely to persist for some time. Responses to the 
Bank’s spring Business Outlook Survey point to moderate growth in business 
fixed investment over the near term, with many firms reporting that uncer­
tainty regarding economic developments is influencing their investment plans 
and decisions, most frequently leading them to postpone projects. Statistics 
Canada’s latest annual survey of private and public investment also implies 
only a gradual rise in business investment growth in the quarters ahead, with 
the average annual nominal rate of growth in 2013 projected to be down from 
2012, notably in the resource sector. Against this backdrop, the Bank now 
forecasts a more subdued pickup in the growth rate of business fixed invest­
ment than was anticipated in the January Report.
Government spending is expected to contribute only very marginally to real 
GDP growth over the projection horizon (Chart 32). While this contribution is 
considerably weaker than has been typical historically, it is in line with the 
plans of federal, provincial and local governments to consolidate spending. 
The profile for government spending is lower than in the January Report, 
reflecting spending plans announced in recent budgets at all levels of govern­
ment, as well as the latest information provided by the National Accounts.

Overall, factors weighing on investment plans in energy and 
mining are likely to persist in the near term . Some of the 
factors dampening investment intentions in other sectors are 
expected to subside over the second half of 2013, as foreign 
demand improves and uncertainty surrounding the economic 
outlook dissipates . In the longer term, the investment outlook 
depends on several developments, notably, stronger demand 
in emerging-market economies and the resolution of bottle-
necks in the infrastructure for transporting North American 
crude oil .

BANK OF CANADA  •  Monetary Policy Report  •  April 2013
The Bank expects net exports to provide a rising, although still relatively 
modest, contribution to GDP growth over the next two years. Available indi­
cators suggest a continued pickup in exports in early 2013 following a sharp 
contraction in the third quarter of 2012, which resulted in part from tem­
porary disruptions in the energy sector (Box 4). Exports are projected to 
continue to grow at a solid pace thereafter, consistent with the strength­
ening of private sector demand in the United States and the projected 
recovery in the global economy more broadly (Box 1). However, the growth 
of exports continues to be restrained by ongoing competitiveness chal­
lenges, including the persistent strength of the Canadian dollar, which is 
being influenced by safe-haven flows and spillovers from global monetary

Box 4
Explaining the Unexpected Weakness of the Canadian Economy in 2012
Canadian economic activity was weaker than expected 
in 2012 . On an average annual basis, real GDP grew by 
1 .8 per cent, compared with the 2 .4 per cent projected in the 
April 2012 Monetary Policy Report . The most important con-
tributors to this unexpected weakness were exports and, to a 
lesser extent, business ﬁ
 xed investment, the eﬀ
 ects of which 
were only partly oﬀ
 set by higher inventory investment and 
weaker imports (Chart 4-A) . Government expenditures and 
household spending were roughly in line with expectations . 
Economic growth in the United States in 2012 was broadly 
consistent with the Bank’s expectations last April, particularly 
in those components of demand most important to Canadian 
exports. largely as a result, the canadian foreign activity 
measure, which is used as a proxy for external demand for 
Canadian products, grew roughly as had been projected in 
April 2012 (Chart 4-B) . Canadian exports thus appear to have 
signiﬁ
 cantly underperformed . 
The weakness in Canadian exports over the past year partly 
refl
 ects idiosyncratic developments unrelated to the strength of 
foreign demand, notably unanticipated disruptions at numerous 
oil-extraction facilities in Canada and temporary pipeline limit-
ations that constrained exports of crude oil . The relative weak-
ness of exports may also refl
 ect shifts in the structure of foreign 
demand for Canadian products, which are not fully captured by 
the foreign activity measure . For example, Canadian exports of 
non-energy commodities to China and other emerging-market 
economies (EMEs) have become more signiﬁ
 cant to Canadian 
trade in recent years . EMEs recovered relatively quickly from 
the global recession, but their economic growth was weaker 
in 2012 than the Bank had expected . Finally, competitiveness 
challenges may also have played a role, with the Canadian dollar 
remaining strong and productivity growth weak .
The Bank’s projection incorporates some further decline 
in exports relative to the foreign activity measure despite 
the anticipated unwinding of the transitory factors that had 
depressed commodity exports (Chart 4-C) . This creates 
some upside risk to exports ahead .

policy. These challenges, coupled with the still-weak level of foreign 
demand, suggest that Canada’s exports will not regain their pre-recession 
peak until the second half of 2014 (Chart 33).
Relative to the January Report, net exports have been revised up some­
what in 2014, reflecting the slightly higher level of foreign demand relative 
to domestic demand. With modest improvements in the real trade bal­
ance, Canada’s sizable current account deficit, which is currently around 
4 per cent of GDP (Chart 34), is projected to narrow gradually over the 
forecast horizon.
Given the above projection for real GDP, the Canadian economy is expected 
to reach full capacity in mid-2015, later than anticipated in the January 
Report.

BANK OF CANADA  •  Monetary Policy Report  •  April 2013
Inflation
Total and core CPI inflation have remained low in recent months, broadly in line 
with expectations in the January Report. There has been considerable monthly 
volatility, however, largely related to movements in auto prices.
The low level of core inflation, at an average of 1.2 per cent in January and 
February, reflects muted price pressures across a wide range of goods and 
services. This is consistent with the material excess capacity in the economy 
as well as heightened competitive pressures on retailers from both domestic 
and foreign sources. The continued expansion of big-box stores in Canada 
and the arrival of large U.S. retailers have been factors, as has the rise in online 
shopping. There has also been an increase in cross-border shopping, stimu­
lated by the persistent strength in the Canadian dollar and the rise in travellers’ 
duty-free exemptions for short stays implemented in June 2012. In addition, a 
number of special factors have put downward pressure on core inflation in 
recent quarters, including slower increases in regulated prices (such as auto 
insurance) and the relatively large impact of past declines in the world prices of 
agricultural commodities on food and clothing prices in Canada.
Total CPI inflation, which averaged 0.9 per cent in January and February, 
has been restrained by low core inflation as well as by declining mortgage 
interest costs, although this has been offset in part by higher prices for 
gasoline in recent months.
Inflation expectations remain well anchored. As reported in the Bank’s 
spring Business Outlook Survey, 93 per cent of firms surveyed expect 
average inflation over the next two years to remain within the 1 to 3 per cent 
inflation-control range. A majority of firms now expect inflation to be in the 
lower half of that range, consistent with the Bank’s inflation projection. 
The April Consensus Economics forecasts for total CPI inflation were 
1.4 per cent in 2013 and 1.8 per cent in 2014. Market-based measures of 
longer-term inflation expectations also continue to be consistent with the 
2 per cent inflation-control target.
Core inflation is expected to remain subdued in coming quarters before 
rising gradually to 2 per cent by mid-2015 (Chart 35), as the economy 
returns to full capacity, the special factors that are weighing on core inflation 
subside, and inflation expectations remain well anchored.10 In addition, while 
wage growth has been relatively subdued recently, partly because of ongoing 
public sector wage restraints, productivity growth has been weak. As a result, 
growth in unit labour costs has risen in recent quarters (Chart 36), which is 
expected to contribute to the anticipated gradual rise in core inflation. The 
projection for core inflation is slightly lower than in the January Report owing 
to the greater-than-anticipated slack in the Canadian economy over most of 
the projection horizon.
Total CPI inflation is projected to remain near 1 per cent through a large part 
of 2013, owing to low core inflation as well as the dampening impact of 
lower mortgage interest costs. Thereafter, total CPI inflation is expected to 
return gradually to target by mid-2015. The profile for total inflation is some­
what lower than in the January Report, mainly because of more subdued 
core inflation.
10	 As previously assumed, the indirect effects associated with the restoration of the provincial sales tax in 
British Columbia are expected to have a minor effect on core inflation over the projection horizon (see 
the April 2012 Monetary Policy Report). 
The low level of core inflation 
is consistent with the material 
excess capacity in the 
economy as well as heightened 
competitive pressures on 
retailers
A number of special factors 
have put downward pressure on 
core inflation
Inflation expectations remain 
well anchored
Core inflation is expected to 
remain subdued in coming 
quarters before rising gradually 
to 2 per cent
Total CPI inflation is expected 
to return gradually to target by 
mid-2015

This projection includes a gradual reduction in monetary stimulus over the 
projection horizon, consistent with achieving the inflation target.
The uncertainty surrounding the Bank’s inflation projection is illustrated 
using fan charts. Chart 37 and Chart 38 depict the 50 per cent and 
90 per cent confidence bands for year-over-year core inflation and total CPI 
inflation from the second quarter of 2013 to the end of 2015.

Risks to the Outlook
The inflation outlook in Canada is subject to upside and downside risks, which 
are similar to those identified in the January Report.
The three main upside risks to inflation in Canada relate to the possibility of 
stronger-than-expected growth in the U.S. and global economies, a sharper-
than-expected rebound in Canadian exports, and renewed momentum in 
Canadian residential investment.

 Private sector demand in the United States has been stronger than 
expected, and could continue to surprise on the upside given the degree 
of household deleveraging that has already taken place. In addition, the 
extraordinary monetary policy measures recently adopted by a number of 
countries could have a larger-than-anticipated effect on global demand and 
commodity prices.

 Growth in Canadian exports could be stronger than expected if exporters 
improve their competitiveness more rapidly than currently assumed. The 
unexpected weakness in exports in the second half of 2012 could also give 
way to a sharper rebound in 2013.

 While residential investment in Canada has declined as expected after 
reaching record-high levels, it could regain momentum, adding to domestic 
demand for a time but reinforcing existing imbalances.
The three main downside risks to inflation in Canada relate to the European 
crisis, more protracted weakness in business investment and exports in Canada, 
and the possibility that growth in Canadian household spending could be 
weaker.

 Failure to contain the crisis in Europe remains the most serious risk facing 
the global and Canadian economies. Even if the crisis stays contained, there 
is a risk that the weakness in Europe could be more protracted and that 
uncertainty could remain elevated for longer than presently projected.

 The projected pickup in Canadian economic growth through 2013 relies 
heavily on an improvement in business investment and net exports. There 
is a risk that the recent poor performance could be extended longer than 
expected, particularly if external demand is weaker or if commodity prices 
are less supportive.

 Continuing high household debt levels in Canada could lead to weaker 
household spending. Relatedly, if there were a sudden weakening in the 
Canadian housing sector, it could have sizable spillover effects on other 
areas of the economy.
Overall, the Bank judges that the risks to the inflation outlook in Canada are 
roughly balanced over the projection horizon.
