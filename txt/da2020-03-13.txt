The Bank of Canada today lowered its target for the overnight rate by 50 basis
points to ¾ percent, effective Monday, March 16, 2020. The Bank Rate is
correspondingly 1 percent and the deposit rate is ½ percent. This unscheduled
rate decision is a proactive measure taken in light of the negative shocks to
Canada’s economy arising from the COVID-19 pandemic and the recent sharp
drop in oil prices.
It is clear that the spread of the coronavirus is having serious consequences for
Canadian families, and for Canada’s economy. In addition, lower prices for oil,
even since our last scheduled rate decision on March 4, will weigh heavily on the
economy, particularly in energy intensive regions.
The Bank will provide a full update of its outlook for the Canadian and global
economies on April 15. As the situation evolves, Governing Council stands ready
to adjust monetary policy further if required to support economic growth and
keep inflation on target.
The Bank has also taken steps to ensure that the Canadian financial system has
sufficient liquidity. These additional measures have been announced in separate
notices on the Bank’s website. The Bank is closely monitoring economic and
financial conditions, in coordination with other G7 central banks and fiscal
authorities.
