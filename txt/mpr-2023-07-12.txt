Canada’s infl
 ation-control strategy
Canada’s infl
 ation-control strategy
Infl
 ation targeting and the economy
 

The objective of Canada’s monetary policy is to promote the 
economic and fi
 nancial well-being of Canadians. Canada’s 
experience with infl
 ation targeting since 1991 has shown that the 
best way that monetary policy can achieve this goal is by maintaining 
a low and stable infl
 ation environment. Doing so fosters confi
 dence 
in the value of money and contributes to sustained economic growth, 
a strong and inclusive labour market and improved living standards.
 

In 2021, the Government of Canada and the Bank of Canada 
renewed the fl
 exible infl
 ation-targeting strategy of the monetary policy 
framework for a further fi
 ve-year period, ending December 31, 2026.1 
 

The infl
 ation target was renewed at the 2% midpoint of the 1%–3% 
control range, with infl
 ation measured as the 12-month rate of 
change in the consumer price index (CPI). 
 

The Government and the Bank agreed that the best contribution 
monetary policy can make to the economic and fi
 nancial 
well-being of Canadians is to continue to focus on price stability. 
The Government and the Bank also agreed that monetary policy 
should continue to support maximum sustainable employment, 
recognizing that maximum sustainable employment is not directly 
measurable and is determined largely by non-monetary factors 
that can change through time. 
 

Further, the Government and the Bank agreed that because well-
anchored infl
 ation expectations are critical to achieving both price 
stability and maximum sustainable employment, the primary objective 
of monetary policy is to maintain low, stable infl
 ation over time. 
Infl
 ation targeting is symmetric and ﬂ
 exible
 

Canada’s infl
 ation-targeting approach is symmetric, which means 
the Bank is equally concerned about infl
 ation rising above or falling 
below the 2% target. 
 

Canada’s infl
 ation-targeting approach is also ﬂ
 exible. Typically, 
the Bank seeks to return infl
 ation to target over a horizon of six to 
eight quarters. However, the most appropriate horizon for returning 
infl
 ation to target will vary depending on the nature and persistence 
of the shocks buffeting the economy.
 

The 2021 agreement with the Government specifi
 es that the 2% 
infl
 ation target remains the cornerstone of the framework. 
 

The agreement further notes that the Bank will continue to use the 
fl
 exibility of the 1%–3% control range to actively seek the maximum 
sustainable level of employment, when conditions warrant. The Bank 
will also continue to leverage the fl
 exibility inherent in the framework 
to help address the challenges of structurally low interest rates by 
using a broad set of policy tools. The Bank will use this fl
 exibility only 
to an extent that is consistent with keeping medium-term infl
 ation 
expectations well anchored at 2%.
Monetary policy tools
 

Because monetary policy actions take time to work their way through 
the economy and have their full effect on infl
 ation, monetary policy 
must be forward-looking.
 

The Bank normally carries out monetary policy through changes 
in the target for the overnight rate of interest (the policy rate). The 
Bank also has a range of monetary policy tools it can use when the 
policy rate is at very low levels. These tools consist of guidance on 
the future evolution of the policy rate, large-scale asset purchases 
(quantitative easing and credit easing), funding for credit measures, 
and negative policy rates. The potential use and sequencing of these 
tools would depend on the economic and fi
 nancial market context.
 

All of the Bank’s monetary policy tools affect total demand for 
Canadian goods and services through their infl
 uence on market 
interest rates, domestic asset prices and the exchange rate. The 
balance between this demand and the economy’s production 
capacity is, over time, the main factor that determines infl
 ation 
pressures in the economy.
Communications
 

Consistent with its commitment to clear, transparent communications, 
the Bank regularly reports its perspectives on the economy and 
infl
 ation. Policy decisions are typically announced on eight pre-set 
days during the year, and full updates to the Bank’s outlook are 
published four times each year in the Monetary Policy Report.
 

The Bank is committed to explaining when it is using the fl
 exibility of 
the infl
 ation-targeting strategy.
 

Given the uncertainty about the maximum sustainable level of 
employment, the Bank will consider a broad range of labour market 
indicators.2 The Bank will also systematically report to Canadians on 
how labour market outcomes have factored into its policy decisions.
Monitoring infl
 ation
 

In the short run, the prices of certain CPI components can be 
particularly volatile and can cause sizable fl
 uctuations in CPI infl
 ation.
 

In setting monetary policy, the Bank seeks to look through such 
transitory movements in CPI infl
 ation and focuses on “core” infl
 ation 
measures that better refl
 ect the underlying trend of infl
 ation. In this 
sense, these measures act as an operational guide to help the Bank 
achieve the CPI infl
 ation target. They are not a replacement for CPI 
infl
 ation.
 

The Bank’s two preferred measures of core infl
 ation are CPI-trim, 
which excludes CPI components whose rates of change in a given 
month are the most extreme, and CPI-median, which corresponds 
to the price change located at the 50th percentile (in terms of basket 
weight) of the distribution of price changes.

Overview 
Overview 
Inflation continues to fall globally, but core inflation in major economies 
remains elevated. In response, several central banks have raised—or 
signalled they will raise—their policy rates further. 
Global economic growth in the first half of 2023 was stronger than had 
been expected at the beginning of the year, with surprisingly robust US 
consumption growth. Growth in global demand should moderate over the 
next year due to monetary policy tightening and a slowdown in China. 
In Canada, inflation has continued to come down. Consumer price index 
(CPI) inflation was 3.4% in May. This represents significant progress toward 
price stability over the past year as inflation has steadily dropped from a high 
of 8.1% last summer. 
However, the downward momentum in inflation is slowing, largely because 
demand in Canada continues to outpace supply. Household spending has 
been robust, supported by strong demand for labour, population growth and 
accumulated household savings. Housing resales and house prices have 
picked up. At the same time, business investment is softening. Labour market 
conditions remain tight but appear to be easing. 
Growth in gross domestic product (GDP) is projected to slow, averaging 
about 1% in the second half of this year and the first half of next year. This 
implies GDP growth of 1.8% in 2023 and 1.2% in 2024. As the cumulative 
interest rate increases work their way through the economy, they will weigh 
on household spending and business investment. Weak foreign demand is 
also expected to slow export growth. GDP growth is projected to gradually 
pick up starting in the second half of 2024, reaching 2.4% in 2025.
Inflation is now projected to remain around 3% over the next year. As excess 
demand dissipates and labour market conditions ease, inflation gradually 
returns to the 2% target in the middle of 2025. This is about two quarters later 
than forecast in the January and April reports.
A considerable amount of uncertainty surrounds the forecast, particularly 
into 2024 and 2025. Three-month rates of core inflation have stayed in the 
3½% to 4% range for some time. While near-term inflation expectations are 
easing, they remain high. And excess demand has been more persistent 
than expected. All this suggests increased risk that the progress toward price 
stability could stall.

Global economy
Global economy
Inflation continues to fall in most regions, but core inflation—especially for 
services—is proving to be stubborn. Tight labour markets, robust consumer 
demand and elevated inflation expectations are generating persistent 
inflationary pressures in many economies. In response, several major central 
banks have raised their policy rates further or signalled more increases are 
likely.
Global economic growth has been stronger than expected. This is especially 
the case in the United States, Canada’s largest trading partner. US consumer 
spending has been surprisingly strong because households continued to 
draw down savings accumulated during the pandemic, and a tight labour 
market has supported incomes. US business investment has also been 
unexpectedly robust. In contrast, economic growth in the euro area has been 
weak, largely as expected.
Over the next year, global economic growth is projected to slow as monetary 
policy further restricts demand. In the United States, fiscal policy restraint 
and reduced spending from pandemic-related savings also weigh on demand 
growth. At the same time, the pace of economic activity in China is expected 
to slow as the boost from the lifting of pandemic restrictions wanes and 
growth of external demand moderates. Global growth is projected to pick 
up modestly in the second half of 2024 before strengthening in 2025, as the 
effects of higher interest rates on economic growth dissipate (Table 1).
Inflation is projected to ease as demand growth slows. Lower goods price 
inflation leads this decline, while services price inflation adjusts more 
gradually. By the end of 2025, inflation is projected to approach central bank 
targets. However, the speed of this decline remains uncertain.

Financial conditions tightened modestly
Global financial conditions are now modestly tighter than they were at the 
start of the year. Yields on government bonds across advanced economies 
have risen as central banks have increased policy rates and markets have 
priced in a more prolonged tightening. Equity returns have risen, mostly 
driven by a small number of technology stocks.
The value of the Canadian dollar is little changed against its US counterpart, 
but it has appreciated against a broader basket of currencies (Chart 1 and 
Box 1).

Persistent inflation 
Inflation has been declining due to falling energy prices, easing supply 
constraints and tighter monetary policy. However, core inflation is not yet on a 
firm downward trend (Chart 2). In many countries, high core inflation reflects 
persistently strong inflation in core services prices. 
Over the projection horizon, inflation is expected to ease toward central bank 
targets in response to tighter monetary conditions and the resulting slowdown 
in demand growth. This pace of adjustment reflects the sluggish response 
of prices for services. Strong demand for services (Chart 3, panel a), tight 
labour markets and elevated expectations for near-term inflation are all 
keeping services price inflation stubbornly high.   
In contrast, inflation in core goods prices is expected to come down faster. 
Demand for manufactured goods is relatively soft (Chart 3, panel b), energy 
prices have declined, and supply chain challenges have been dissipating. 
Box 1
Key inputs to the projection 
The Bank of Canada’s projection is conditional on 
several key inputs and assumptions about their future 
path. The Bank regularly reviews these assumptions 
and adjusts the economic projection accordingly. The 
key inputs to the Bank’s projection are as follows:
 
 Oil prices are lower than in the April Report. Over 
the projection horizon, the per-barrel prices in 
US dollars are assumed to be $80 for Brent, $75 
for West Texas Intermediate and $60 for Western 
Canadian Select. These prices are all $5 lower than 
in the April Report.
 
 By convention, the Bank does not forecast the 
exchange rate in the Monetary Policy Report. The 
Canadian dollar is assumed to remain at 75 cents 
US over the projection horizon, close to its recent 
average and roughly unchanged relative to the 
April Report.
 
 Potential output growth in Canada is expected to 
increase from 1.4% in 2022 to about 2% per year 
over the projection horizon. 
 
 Real gross domestic product (GDP) is estimated to 
have grown at about 1.5% in the second quarter of 
2023, below potential output growth. As a result, the 
Bank estimates that the output gap is between 0% 
and 1% in the second quarter. This is slightly less 
excess demand than estimated for the fi
 rst quarter.1
 
 The projection incorporates information from all 
provincial and federal budgets available at the time 
of writing. Government spending is growing by about 
2% per year, contributing 0.5 percentage points on 
average to GDP growth over the projection horizon.
 
 The nominal neutral interest rate in Canada is 
estimated to be in the range of 2% to 3%.2 The 
economic projection assumes that the neutral rate is 
at the midpoint of this range.
1 The estimate for the output gap for the fi
 rst quarter of 2023 is 0.25% to 1.25%, 
unchanged from the estimate in the April Report.
2 The nominal neutral interest rate is defi
 ned as the real neutral rate plus 2% for 
infl
 ation. The real neutral rate is the rate consistent with both output remaining 
sustainably at its potential and infl
 ation remaining at target on an ongoing 
basis. It is a medium- to long-term equilibrium concept. For more details,

Buoyant but slowing US economy
Despite the surprising strength of US consumption and investment spending 
during the first half of 2023, economic growth in the United States is slowing 
(Chart 4). Growth is projected to stall in the first half of 2024 due to restrictive 
monetary conditions, tighter fiscal policy and less support from accumulated 
savings. As spending wanes, unemployment starts to rise and wage growth 
eases. Slowing US economic activity and the rebalancing in consumption 
away from goods toward services are projected to weaken demand for 
imports, including from Canada. In the second half of 2024 and in 2025, 
US economic growth increases as the impact of tightening of monetary policy 
fades. 
Weak growth in the euro area
Economic growth in the euro area effectively stalled over the first half 
of the year. Weak consumer sentiment, declining purchasing power and 
the tightening of monetary policy are weighing on domestic demand. 
The manufacturing sector is contracting as foreign demand for goods is 
slowing. At the same time, activity in the services sector has been robust as 
households continue to catch up on services they missed out on during the 
pandemic.
Economic growth is projected to remain weak through mid-2024 as monetary 
policy continues to dampen demand and bring inflation back toward the 
European Central Bank’s target. Growth then strengthens in 2025.
Slow growth in China after surge
After surging earlier in the year, China’s growth is slowing. The rebound in 
activity in the services sector that followed the lifting of COVID-19 restrictions 
resulted in a more rapid pickup in growth than had been expected earlier this 
year. But the rebound is now fading faster than previously projected. Slowing

global growth is weighing on exports, especially of manufactured goods, 
and domestic confidence is low. Additionally, the property sector remains 
weakened by past overbuilding. 
In the projection, policy easing is assumed to provide some support to the 
economy through 2024. Growth slows in 2025 due to a shrinking workforce 
and slowing business investment.
Lower oil prices
Oil prices have declined further over the past three months, with the price of 
Brent oil generally around US$75 per barrel (Chart 5). The fall in oil prices 
largely reflects market concerns that weakness in future global industrial 
activity will restrain demand. 
However, oil prices would likely rise if demand evolved in line with the 
Bank of Canada’s projection for global growth and oil supply did not keep 
up. To better balance these risks, the Bank assumes Brent oil prices to be 
US$80 per barrel over the projection. 
Natural gas prices have been relatively stable for several months compared 
with the volatility in 2022. Base metal prices have fallen, mostly in response 
to weak activity in China’s housing market and industrial sector. Other non-
energy commodity prices are roughly unchanged.

Considerable progress has been made in the Bank’s efforts to return inflation 
back to the 2% target. Inflation fell from a peak of 8.1% last summer to 3.4% 
in May 2023. 
Economic activity—especially household spending—has proven surprisingly 
strong, supported by tight labour markets, rapid population growth and the 
high level of accumulated household savings.1 Consumption growth in the 
first quarter of 2023, at 5.8%, was stronger than expected. This strength was 
observed both in goods that are sensitive to interest rates and in services. 
Housing resales and house prices also picked up earlier than anticipated. At 
the same time, the labour market remained tight, having eased only mildly 
since the beginning of the year.
Economic growth is projected to moderate to an average of about 1% 
through the second half of 2023 and the first half of 2024 (Table 2 and 
Table 3). This slowdown results from the effects of higher interest rates on 
household spending and business investment as well as the fading of some 
temporary factors. Weak foreign demand also restrains export growth. In 
the second half of 2024, GDP growth is expected to pick up as the effect of 
higher interest rates on economic growth dissipates. Foreign demand also 
strengthens, boosting exports. 
Going forward, further easing of inflation will likely take longer than expected 
in previous reports, with inflation projected to remain near 3% for the next 
year. Greater excess demand and more stubborn core inflation are sustaining 
underlying price pressures. Tight monetary policy weighs on demand 
growth, and the economy is projected to enter into mild excess supply in 
the beginning of 2024. Inflation should then ease, reaching the 2% target in 
the middle of 2025. The return of inflation to target is expected to occur two 
quarters later than previously projected.
1	 In this Report, the Bank compares its most recent outlook with that from the January 2023 Report. This 
longer time frame provides a better perspective on the accumulated evidence of how the economy and 
inflation have evolved. The projections from the April Report are provided in Table 2 and Table 3.

Persistent inflationary pressures
CPI inflation in Canada has declined from 8.1% in June 2022 to 3.4% in May. 
Inflation has been easing with lower energy prices, improvements in global 
supply chains and the effects of higher interest rates moving through the 
economy. In recent months, rising refinery margins have mitigated some of 
the impact of lower oil prices on inflation. Because energy prices in particular 
can cause significant volatility in inflation, gauging underlying inflationary 
pressures by examining measures of core inflation is useful.

Core inflation continues to edge down, but that is due largely to base-year 
effects as the large price increases from last spring drop from the year-over-
year calculations. In contrast, three-month rates of core inflation have stalled 
in the range of 3½% to 4% since September 2022 (Chart 6), which is almost 
1 percentage point above the Bank’s expectations in January. 
Other three-month rates of inflation show a similar pattern, with little to no 
progress since the summer of 2022 (Chart 7). 
The stubbornness of core inflation in Canada suggests that inflation may 
be more persistent than originally thought. A similar pattern exists in other 
economies.

Surprisingly strong demand 
Economic activity was robust in the first quarter of 2023, and growth over the 
first half of the year will likely surpass expectations at the time of the January 
Report. An increase in the population due to strong inflows of newcomers to 
Canada supported this growth.2   
Consumption spending per capita across a broad range of goods and 
services surged unexpectedly in the first quarter. Spending on interest-rate-
sensitive goods such as furniture, clothing and recreational equipment was 
surprisingly strong (Chart 8). Based on recent retail sales data, strength 
in goods consumption seems to have continued. In addition, spending on 
services has been robust, continuing to recover from the impact of the 
COVID-19 pandemic.
Homebuyers have started returning to the resale market (Chart 9, panel a). 
In an environment of lagging supply, house prices increased in May for the 
second consecutive month (Chart 9, panel b). Increases in both resales 
and prices have been widespread across the country and stronger than 
anticipated in January.

The unexpected strength of household spending over the first half of 2023 
appears to reflect several factors—some of which are temporary, while others 
could be persistent:
	
 a tight labour market 
	
 population growth resulting from increased arrivals of newcomers to Canada
	
 accumulated household savings
	
 pent-up demand for services 
	
 fiscal measures in recent federal and provincial budgets  
Disentangling the effects from these factors is difficult. In the projection, the 
Bank tries to balance the risks around the outlook for household spending, 
but risks remain. 
An unexpected increase in exports, partly related to stronger-than-expected 
foreign demand, also supported economic activity and the labour market 
in the first half of 2023. As well, improvements in supply chains boosted 
shipments of motor vehicles abroad. 
Tight labour market with some signs of easing
With strong overall demand, the labour market remains tight. A broad range 
of indicators suggest that it is still above maximum sustainable employment 
(Chart 10). Labour demand remains strong, and job gains have been 
robust, with about 290,000 net new jobs created in the first six months of 
2023. Many new entrants to the labour market have been hired quickly. The 
unemployment rate has edged up but remains low by historical standards. 
Wage growth has been in a range of about 4% to 5% (Chart 11).

At the same time, tighter monetary policy appears to be moderating the 
demand for labour. Job vacancies have declined since the January Report, 
and net job creation has been below the pace implied by population growth 
in recent months (Chart 12). As well, respondents to the Business Outlook 
Survey for the second quarter of 2023 noted that finding the workers they 
need has become easier. Firms attribute this to less competition for labour 
and improved labour supply.

Slowing demand growth and rising supply
Economic growth in Canada is expected to moderate over the next year. 
Higher interest rates have raised debt-service costs and lowered the amount 
of money households and firms have available to spend on goods and 
services. Higher rates have raised the cost of new borrowing and slowed 
household credit growth. This has weighed on purchases of big-ticket items 
such as homes, motor vehicles and other consumer durables. When demand 
slows, production ultimately catches up. Both demand for labour and wage 
growth then ease, reinforcing the slowdown in overall demand. 
Exports are projected to decline as the impacts of higher rates abroad, 
particularly in the United States, weigh on the demand for imports from 
Canada. Moreover, the effect of some of the factors temporarily supporting 
export growth—such as the recovery of motor vehicle production with the 
resolution of supply chain issues—is anticipated to fade. 
Real GDP growth is estimated to have slowed in the second quarter of 2023 
to 1.5% and is projected to moderate to an average of about 1% through 
the second half of 2023 and the first half of 2024. This is below population 
growth, which is expected to grow 1.9% on average over this period 
(Chart 13 and Table 3). Declines in real GDP per capita largely reflect per 
capita reductions in consumption and weak business investment.
Economic activity is projected to pick up in the second half of 2024 as the 
effects of monetary policy tightening on growth fade (Table 2). GDP growth is 
expected to rise from 1.2% in 2024 to 2.4% in 2025.
Potential output growth is assumed to average about 2% over the projection 
horizon, reflecting solid growth in trend labour input and a pickup in trend 
labour productivity growth. The labour force is projected to expand robustly 
due to strong immigration and an ongoing influx of temporary residents, 
which more than offset the effects of an aging population.

Revised outlook for infl
 ation and economic activity  
This box focuses on the revisions to the outlook for 
infl
 ation and economic activity since the January Report.1 
Since the January Report, the outlook for infl
 ation has 
been revised up. Consumer price index (CPI) infl
 ation 
is forecast to be higher by as much as 0.4 percentage 
points in the fi
 rst half of 2024 (Chart 2-A). As well, 
infl
 ation is now expected to return to 2% in the middle of 
2025, two quarters later than projected in January and 
April. Core infl
 ation is also projected to be higher—by as 
much as 0.5 percentage points in the fi
 rst quarter of 2024.
The upward revision to the infl
 ation outlook is due to:
 
 more persistent excess demand 
 
 higher-than-expected house prices
 
 higher-than-expected prices for tradable goods
1 In this Report, the Bank compares its most recent outlook with that from the 
January 2023 Report. This longer time frame provides a better perspective 
on the accumulated evidence of how the economy and infl
 ation have evolved. 
The projections from the April Report are also provided in the charts within

Box 2 (continued)
Excess demand
The forecast for excess demand through 2023 has 
been revised up by almost 1 percentage point since the 
January Report (Chart 2-B). The rebalancing of supply 
and demand is now expected to happen in early 2024, 
three quarters later than previously anticipated.
In particular, the outlook for consumption has been 
revised up. A stronger outlook for house prices 
compared with January is increasing household net 
worth and is expected to boost consumer spending. 
Other factors contributing to the upward revision to the 
consumption outlook include:
 
 the tighter-than-expected labour market 
 
 greater pent-up demand for services
 
 fi
 scal measures in recent federal and provincial 
budgets
House prices
The faster-than-expected pickup in housing resales, 
combined with a lack of supply, has pushed house 
prices higher than anticipated in January (Chart 2-C). 
The previously unforeseen strength in house prices 
is likely to persist and boost infl
 ation by as much as 
0.3 percentage points by the end of 2023, compared 
with the January outlook.
Tradable goods prices
Infl
 ation for goods excluding food and energy has 
continued to fall, although more gradually than expected 
at the time of the January Report. This has occurred 
at a time when growth in input costs is moderating and 
supply chain disruptions have been resolving more 
quickly than anticipated at the start of the year. 
Some possible explanations behind the stronger-than-
expected goods price infl
 ation include:
 
 slower normalization of pricing behaviour by fi
 rms 
abroad. Strong global demand may have motivated 
businesses to pass through ongoing cost reductions 
more slowly than anticipated, partly explaining 
higher-than-expected import prices in 2023.
 
 weaker growth in labour productivity in the goods 
sector due to deglobalization and de-risking of 
supply chains. 
Although goods price infl
 ation (excluding food and 
energy) is expected to ease further, it remains 
temporarily higher than in January. In contrast, services 
price infl
 ation has been in line with the January forecast. 
Infl
 ation in services, excluding shelter, is expected to 
slow further over the projection horizon.

Household spending growth to moderate
Growth in consumption spending is projected to slow over the next year as 
demand for interest-rate-sensitive goods and services weakens and more 
households renew their mortgage at higher rates (Chart 14 and Box 3). 
Income growth also slows as the labour market comes into balance, weighing 
on consumption spending growth.
After contracting for one year, spending on residential investment is expected 
to grow again, supported by strong inflows of newcomers to Canada. In 
recent months, house prices have moved up. This strength is projected to

Box 3
Household ﬁ
 nancial health
1 Credit utilization rate is defi
 ned as the percentage of a loan’s available credit limit that is currently being used.
Debt-service costs are rising as elevated interest rates 
work their way through the economy, leading households 
to cut back on their discretionary spending. The current 
high level of household debt amplifi
 es this impact, but the 
extent of the increase in debt-service costs differs across 
segments of the population. This box takes a deeper look 
at the impact of higher interest rates using microeconomic 
indicators of households’ fi
 nancial positions. 
These indicators show that the fi
 nancial positions of 
many households remain healthy, due in part to strong 
labour markets and the buildup of large liquid savings 
since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. For these 
households, higher interest rates are unlikely to lead to 
severe fi
 nancial stress or have disproportionately large 
effects on their spending. 
There is, however, a smaller portion of households 
who are experiencing considerable fi
 nancial stress. 
While most indicators of household fi
 nancial stress 
remain below pre-pandemic levels, there are signs 
that some households are relying more on credit card 
debt, and some have fallen behind on their payments. 
These households are likely to cut their spending by 
disproportionately more than others.
It’s also important to note that the full effect of rate 
increases has yet to be felt by some borrowers. 
Over time, as borrowers renew mortgages and other 
loans with fi
 xed rates and payment schedules, more 
households will face higher debt-service costs.  
Household ﬁ
 nancial stress 
While delinquency rates have been rising, most continue 
to be below pre-pandemic levels (see Indicators of 
fi
 nancial vulnerabilities and Chart 3-A). In particular, 
the delinquency rates on mortgage loans are near all-
time lows. This is true even for variable-rate mortgage 
holders with variable payments, who have felt the 
largest impact of elevated interest rates so far. 
Other measures of fi
 nancial stress have also remained 
close to historical lows, including utilization rates for 
home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) as well as the 
share of HELOCs and line of credit accounts with a 
utilization rate above 90%.1 
Credit data show that borrowers are using their credit 
cards more extensively than they have in the past. The 
share of credit card accounts reaching their credit limit is

Note: HELOC is home equity line of credit, and “HELOC utilization rate” is the percentage of a HELOC’s available credit limit that is being used. The indicator for 
the HELOC utilization rate is the share of the overall credit limit for HELOCs used by borrowers. Indicators of a utilization rate above 90% are the share of accounts 
falling into those categories. “60+ days late” show the shares of borrowers falling into those categories. Data available from TransUnion go back to 2015. To protect 
the privacy of Canadians, TransUnion did not provide any personal information to the Bank. The TransUnion dataset was anonymized, meaning it does not include

Soft business investment and declining export growth
Business investment growth is expected to be soft through to the middle of 
2024, dampened by weak demand for Canadian exports, high financing costs 
and the winding down of large infrastructure projects (Chart 15). Businesses 
cite elevated borrowing costs, tight credit conditions and the prospect of 
slowing economic activity as key factors holding back investment.
After a strong start to 2023, non-commodity exports are expected to decline 
through 2024 as foreign demand weakens. In contrast, commodity exports 
are projected to grow modestly, supported by supply improvements, including 
the completion of the Trans Mountain Expansion project in 2024.
Box 3 (continued)
at a historical high for non-mortgage holders, although it 
remains below the median for mortgage holders. 
In addition, although overall delinquency rates on loans 
remain relatively low, the share of borrowers moving 
from 60 to 90+ days late on any credit product has risen 
and is now close to a historical high. This suggests that 
borrowers who are already behind on their payments 
are increasingly likely to see a further deterioration 
2 The new version of the Household Risk Assessment Model builds on the original by explicitly modelling household consumption, savings and mortgage repayment 
decisions. For information on the original model, see B. Peterson and T. Roberts, “Household Risk Assessment Model,” Bank of Canada Technical Report No. 106 
(September 2016).
in their fi
 nancial situation, suggesting that fi
 nancial 
stress—while not broad-based—is signifi
 cant for some 
segments of the population.  
To date, approximately one-third of mortgage holders 
have been directly affected by higher rates. As this 
share increases over the coming quarters, more 
households will face higher debt-service costs. 
Mortgage holders with variable-rate fi
 xed payments 
could be particularly exposed. As these borrowers 
renew their mortgage and return to their original 
amortization schedule, they could face large increases 
in payments.
Strong labour markets and large ﬁ
 nancial buﬀ
 ers
Large fi
 nancial buffers that accumulated during the 
pandemic, combined with the strength of the labour 
market, are supporting borrowers facing higher debt-
service costs. Simulations from the new version of the 
Bank of Canada’s Household Risk Assessment Model 
show liquid savings have increased signifi
 cantly for 
three-quarters of households (Chart 3-B).2 The Bank’s 
Canadian Survey of Consumer Expectations for the 
second quarter of 2023 fi
 nds that mortgage holders—
including those renewing within the next 12 months—
are confi
 dent they will be able to make higher payments. 
The fi
 nancial health of Canadian households may 
change as economic circumstances evolve. The Bank 
will be watching closely the indicators of fi
 nancial stress.

Inflation at target in 2025
CPI inflation declined to 3.4% in May and is expected to remain near 3% 
for about a year. The first stage of this decline in inflation—from about 8% 
in June 2022 to its current rate—occurred rapidly, reflecting large declines 
in oil prices, lower inflation in other goods prices and base-year effects as 
large past increases in these prices fall out. The drop in inflation for goods 
excluding food and energy resulted from slowing growth in global demand, 
improving supply chains and a decline in the costs of some imported goods. 
These factors are expected to continue to contribute to weaker inflation over 
the projection horizon, but their impact is shrinking (Chart 16).  
Looking ahead, the next stage in the decline of inflation toward target is 
expected to take longer and is more uncertain. This is partly due to elevated 
services inflation, which can adjust sluggishly, and uncertainty about 
expected inflation. 
Slowing domestic demand is central to the anticipated decline in inflationary 
pressures. At the beginning of last year, strong excess demand in the context 
of rising costs made it easier for firms to fully pass cost increases onto prices. 
However, as the economy rebalances and the excess demand dissipates, not 
only will direct inflationary pressures from strong demand ease, but the ability 
of firms to pass along cost increases will also diminish. 
Results from the Bank’s Business Leaders’ Pulse survey indicate that firms 
continue to expect larger-than-normal price increases and more-frequent-
than-normal price changes (Chart 17). The frequency of price changes, in 
particular, is greater when high inflation and demand are strong. However, 
firms’ responses are indicating that price-setting behaviour will continue to 
normalize.

BANK OF CANADA  •  Monetary Policy Report  •  July 2023
Firms responding to the Bank’s Business Outlook Survey for the second 
quarter of 2023 indicated that supply chains and labour shortages are 
becoming less pressing issues. Meanwhile, firms are increasingly concerned 
about slowing demand. In the face of strong wage gains, businesses are 
looking for opportunities to become more efficient and lower their costs. 
Inflation is expected to return to 2% in the middle of 2025, although the timing 
is uncertain given the gradual movement of inflation toward the target in the 
outlook. The delayed return to target largely reflects the greater persistence 
of excess demand in 2023, the upward revision to house prices and, to a 
lesser extent, higher-than-expected imported goods prices (Box 2).
Near-term survey-based inflation expectations remain elevated. In the base 
case, inflation expectations are assumed to return to the 2% target relatively 
quickly and with a mild slowdown in the economy. This soft landing occurs 
because inflation expectations are assumed to be well anchored to the 
inflation target as they have been for many years. However, with inflation 
above target for more than two years and with it projected to remain close to 
3% for an additional year, it is possible that inflation expectations will remain 
higher for longer. If that were to occur, inflationary pressures would be more 
persistent.

Risks to the inflation outlook
Risks to the inflation outlook
The outlook in the base-case scenario is the most likely outcome for 
inflation, and the Bank sees both upside and downside risks to this 
outlook. On the upside, high inflation, if left unchecked, could be more 
persistent than expected. As well, household spending could be stronger 
than projected, which would create more excess demand and increase 
inflationary pressures. On the downside, goods price inflation may be 
weaker than anticipated as global cost pressures dissipate. In addition, the 
global economy could face a more marked slowdown than in the base-case 
projection, leading to downward pressures on demand for Canadian exports 
and on prices for commodities and tradable goods. 
In assessing the risks, with inflation above target for two years and expected 
to stay close to 3% for an additional year, the Bank is concerned that 
progress toward price stability could stall and that inflation could rise again if 
there are positive surprises. 
Main upside risks
Inflation expectations could be more stubborn 
Since reaching its peak of 8.1% in June 2022, CPI inflation has been trending 
downward. In the base-case outlook, inflation remains close to 3% until the 
middle of 2024 and then continues to slow, reaching the 2% target in the 
middle of 2025. 
Over the projection, inflation expectations are assumed to be well anchored 
to the inflation target. As a result, expectations return to target relatively 
quickly, as they typically have for the last 25 years. Firmly anchored inflation 
expectations limit the knock-on inflationary effects shocks can have, 
including those from the relative price shocks (i.e., higher prices for energy 
and tradable goods) that played an important role in the rise in inflation. As 
a result, when the shocks dissipate, a relatively modest amount of excess 
supply is needed to bring inflation back to target.  
However, with inflation above target for more than two years and with 
it projected to remain close to 3% over an additional year, firms and 
households could expect inflation to return to target more gradually. 
This possibility could already be reflected in the evolution of some key 
nominal measures. In Canada, three-month rates of core inflation have been 
stuck in the range of 3½% to 4% since September 2022. At the same time, 
wages have been growing at around 4% to 5% for about a year, despite the 
weakness in productivity growth.

BANK OF CANADA  •  Monetary Policy Report  •  July 2023
If firm and household inflation expectations remain elevated for longer, actual 
inflation would also be more persistent. This would make a timely return of 
inflation to target more challenging, and the output losses larger.
Household spending could be stronger
Another upside risk is that the outlook for household spending could be 
stronger than expected, leading to greater inflationary pressures. Since 
the beginning of the pandemic, many Canadians have accumulated a 
considerable amount of savings. For example, households’ bank deposits 
have increased by more than $330 billion, and they are still growing. The 
projection assumes that households are treating these savings as wealth. 
The tendency to consume from this wealth, especially for high-income 
households, is relatively low. However, Canadian households could spend 
more aggressively from their accumulated savings, as US households have 
done. 
Main downside risks
Past increases in prices of intermediate and final goods could 
reverse
Core goods price inflation has fallen significantly since the middle of 2022. It 
is expected to continue to ease over the projection. There is a risk, however, 
that the inflation of many goods prices may fall more sharply than assumed 
in the projection. Several input costs, including for energy and transportation, 
have fallen, and supply chain disruptions have been dissipating. Over time, 
prices may reflect these cost reversals more prominently than they have to 
date. 
Global activity could be weaker
A severe global slowdown is another key downside risk to inflation. Advanced 
economies continue to tighten monetary policy, and global activity could slow 
by more than expected. Weaker global demand could lead to softer prices 
for commodities and tradable goods. It is also possible that higher policy 
rates could interact with long-standing global financial vulnerabilities, such as 
elevated levels of debt, to significantly slow global growth further. 
Canadian economic growth and inflation would be dragged down if these 
risks materialized.
