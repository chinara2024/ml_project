The Bank of Canada today announced that it is maintaining its target for the
overnight rate at 1 per cent. The Bank Rate is correspondingly 1 1/4 per cent and
the deposit rate is 3/4 per cent.
The profile for global economic growth has improved since the Bank released its
January Monetary Policy Report (MPR). Europe is expected to emerge slowly from
recession in the second half of 2012, although the risks around this outlook
remain high.  The profile for U.S. growth is slightly stronger, reflecting the balance
of somewhat improved labour markets, financial conditions and confidence on
the one hand, and emerging fiscal consolidation and ongoing household
deleveraging on the other.  Economic activity in emerging-market economies is
expected to moderate to a still-robust pace over the projection horizon,
supported by an easing of macroeconomic policies.  Improved global economic
prospects, supply disruptions and geopolitical risks have kept commodity prices
elevated.  In particular, the international price of oil has risen further and is now
considerably higher than that received by Canadian producers.  If sustained, these
oil price developments could dampen the improvement in economic momentum.
Overall, economic momentum in Canada is slightly firmer than the Bank had
expected in January. The external headwinds facing Canada have abated
somewhat, with the U.S. recovery more resilient and financial conditions more
supportive than previously anticipated.  As a result, business and household
confidence are improving faster than forecast in January. The Bank projects that
private domestic demand will account for almost all of Canada’s economic growth
over the projection horizon.  Household spending is expected to remain high
relative to GDP as households add to their debt burden, which remains the
biggest domestic risk.  Business investment is projected to remain robust,
reflecting solid balance sheets, very favourable credit conditions, continuing
strong terms of trade and heightened competitive pressures.  The contribution of
government spending to growth is expected to be quite modest over the
projection horizon, in line with recent federal and provincial budgets. The
recovery in net exports is likely to remain weak in light of modest external
demand and ongoing competitiveness challenges, including the persistent
strength of the Canadian dollar.

The Bank projects that the economy will grow by 2.4 per cent in both 2012 and
2013 before moderating to 2.2 per cent in 2014. The degree of economic slack has
been somewhat smaller than the Bank had anticipated in January, and the
economy is now expected to return to full capacity in the first half of 2013.
As a result of this reduced slack and higher gasoline prices, the profile for inflation
is expected to be somewhat firmer than anticipated in January.  After moderating
this quarter, total CPI inflation is expected, along with core inflation, to be around
2 per cent over the balance of the projection horizon as the economy reaches its
production potential, the growth of labour compensation remains moderate, and
inflation expectations stay well-anchored.
Reflecting all of these factors, the Bank has decided to maintain the target for the
overnight rate at 1 per cent. In light of the reduced slack in the economy and
firmer underlying inflation, some modest withdrawal of the present considerable
monetary policy stimulus may become appropriate, consistent with achieving the
2 per cent inflation target over the medium term. The timing and degree of any
such withdrawal will be weighed carefully against domestic and global economic
developments.
