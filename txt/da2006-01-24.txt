The Bank of Canada today announced that it is raising its target for the overnight
rate by one-quarter of one percentage point to 3 1/2 per cent. The operating band
for the overnight rate is correspondingly increased, and the Bank Rate is now 3
3/4 per cent.
Information received since the last interest rate announcement on 6 December
indicates that the Canadian and global economies are evolving essentially in line
with the Bank's expectations as set out in the October Monetary Policy Report
(MPR). The Canadian economy continues to adjust to global developments and to
the associated changes in relative prices. CPI inflation, at 2.3 per cent in the fourth
quarter of 2005, was lower than expected primarily because of lower gasoline
prices. As anticipated, core inflation remained stable at 1.6 per cent. The level of
economic activity at year end was close to expectations.
The outlook for growth and inflation in Canada is similar to that in the October
MPR. The Bank continues to judge that the Canadian economy is operating at its
production capacity and will grow roughly in line with production potential
through 2007. CPI and core inflation should return to the 2 per cent target by the
first half of 2007. Risks to the Bank's projection remain balanced for 2006 and
tilted to the downside through 2007 and beyond. Further details of the Bank's
outlook for output and inflation will be discussed in the Monetary Policy Report
Update, to be released on 26 January 2006.
In line with the Bank's base-case projection and current assessment of risks, some
modest further increase in the policy interest rate would be required to keep
aggregate supply and demand in balance and inflation on target over the medium
term.
