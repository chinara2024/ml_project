The Bank of Canada today announced that it is maintaining its target for the
overnight rate at 1 per cent. The Bank Rate is correspondingly 1 1/4 per cent and
the deposit rate is 3/4 per cent.
The heightened uncertainty around the global economic outlook has decreased in
the weeks since the Bank released its January Monetary Policy Report (MPR). With
tentative signs of stabilisation in European bank funding and sovereign debt
markets, conditions in global financial markets have improved and risk aversion
has decreased. However, the global economy is still expected to grow below its
trend rate as the deleveraging process in advanced economies proceeds.  The U.S.
expansion is proceeding at a modest pace, reinforced by recent improvements in
the labour market.  Growth in China is moderating to a still-high rate as expected,
in response to past policy tightening and weaker external demand. Commodity
prices are higher than anticipated, supported by improved global economic
conditions and a geo-political risk premium on oil.  If sustained, the latter could
ultimately dampen the improvement in global economic momentum.
Recent developments suggest that the outlook for the Canadian economy is
marginally improved from the January MPR.  Although the economy will likely
grow faster than forecast in the first quarter due to temporary factors, underlying
economic momentum remains around trend, balancing domestic strength and
external weakness.  Private demand is now expected to be slightly stronger than
projected, owing to improved sentiment and highly-supportive financial
conditions.  Canadian household spending is expected to remain high relative to
GDP as households add to their debt burden, which remains the biggest domestic
risk.  Net exports have been supported by stronger-than-anticipated U.S. activity
but are expected to contribute little to growth, reflecting still-moderate foreign
demand and ongoing competitiveness challenges, including the persistent
strength of the Canadian dollar.

The profile for core and total CPI inflation is somewhat firmer than previously
anticipated as a result of reduced economic slack and higher oil prices.  After
moderating in the second quarter, total inflation is expected, along with core
inflation, to be around 2 per cent over the forecast horizon, reflecting the
combination of modest growth of labour compensation, an economy operating
around its potential over time, and well-anchored inflation expectations.
Reflecting all of these factors, the Bank has decided to maintain the target for the
overnight rate at 1 per cent. With the target interest rate near historic lows and
the financial system functioning well, there is considerable monetary policy
stimulus in Canada. The Bank will continue to monitor carefully economic and
financial developments in the Canadian and global economies, together with the
evolution of risks, and set monetary policy consistent with achieving the 2 per
cent inflation target over the medium term.
