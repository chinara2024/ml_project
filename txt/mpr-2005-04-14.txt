CANADA’S INFLATION-CONTROL STRATEGY
Inflation control and the economy
• Inflation control is not an end in itself; it is the means whereby monetary
policy contributes to solid economic performance.
• Low inflation allows the economy to function more effectively. This con-
tributes to better economic growth over time and works to moderate
cyclical fluctuations in output and employment.
The monetary policy instrument
• Announcements regarding the Bank’s policy instrument—the target over-
night interest rate—take place, under normal circumstances, on eight pre-
specified dates during the year.
• In setting a target for the overnight rate, the Bank of Canada influences
short-term interest rates to achieve a rate of monetary expansion consis-
tent with the inflation-control target. The transmission mechanism is com-
plex and involves long and variable lags—the impact on inflation from
changes in policy rates is usually spread over six to eight quarters.
The targets
• In February 1991, the federal government and the Bank of Canada jointly
announced a series of targets for reducing total CPI inflation to the mid-
point of a range of 1 to 3 per cent by the end of 1995. That inflation-con-
trol target range was extended a number of times, most recently in May
2001, in this last case to the end of 2006. Monetary policy will continue to
aim at keeping future inflation at the 2 per cent target midpoint of this
range, both to maximize the likelihood that inflation stays within the tar-
get range and to increase the predictability of inflation over the longer
term (Crawford 2001).
Monitoring inflation
• In the short run, a good deal of movement in the CPI is caused by transi-
tory fluctuations in the prices of such volatile components as fruit and
gasoline, as well as by changes in indirect taxes. For this reason, the Bank
focuses on a core measure of CPI inflation that excludes the eight most vol-
atile components of the CPI and adjusts the remaining components to
remove the effect of changes in indirect taxes. Core inflation also tends to
be a better predictor of future changes in the total CPI than does the recent
history of CPI inflation (Macklem 2001).

MONETARY POLICY REPORT
— April 2005 —
This is a report of the Governing Council of the Bank of Canada:
David Dodge, Paul Jenkins, Sheryl Kennedy, Pierre Duguay,
David Longworth, and Tiff Macklem.
The Canadian economy has had to adjust to
sharp movements, not just in the external value
of our dollar, but also in the foreign demand for
many of our goods and services. Inflation target-
ing gives the Bank an important guideline for
dealing with the currency appreciation, allowing
us to maintain our focus on macroeconomic sta-
bilization at a time when various sectors of the
economy are dealing with the exchange rate
shock.

Foreword: Ten Years of the Monetary Policy Report
Ten years ago this spring, the Bank of Canada issued its first
semi-annual Monetary Policy Report.
The Introduction to that Report noted that
The report reflects the framework used by the
Bank in its conduct of policy. This framework
includes: (i) a clear policy objective, (ii) a
medium-term perspective (given the long lags
for the full impact of monetary policy actions on
the economy) and (iii) a recognition that mone-
tary policy works through both interest rates
and the exchange rate.
The ultimate objective of Canadian monetary
policy is to promote good overall economic per-
formance. Monetary policy can contribute to this
goal by preserving confidence in the value of
money through price stability. In other words,
price stability is a means to an end, not an end
in itself.
Although our framework has been refined over time, these
statements are as true today as they were in 1995. The interim
period has represented the best 10 consecutive years of good
economic performance that Canada has seen in the last
35 years, and a transparent inflation-targeting regime has been
a significant contributor to this outcome. The introduction of
the Monetary Policy Report marked a major step forward in the
transparency of the Bank’s conduct of monetary policy. With
the changes we have made through time to make the Report
more transparent, it continues to serve us well in our commu-
nications with the public.

1. OVERVIEW
The global economy has been unfolding largely as expected,
and prospects for continued robust growth are quite favourable,
especially over the near term. Against this backdrop, the outlook
for the Canadian economy through to the end of 2006 is essen-
tially unchanged from that in the January Monetary Policy Report
Update.
The Canadian economy continues to adjust to major global
developments. These include the realignment of currencies in
response to global imbalances, the higher prices of both energy
and non-energy commodities, and growing competition from
emerging-market economies.
The sectoral adjustments to these developments are becoming
more evident. Many Canadian commodity-producing sectors are
expanding. However, firms in a number of other sectors exposed
to international trade are facing pressure from the appreciation of
the Canadian dollar and from foreign competition. On balance, net
exports have been a drag on the economy. But with robust domes-
tic demand, some sectors—such as retail, wholesale, and hous-
ing—have been growing strongly. Canadian monetary policy
continues to facilitate the adjustment process by aiming to keep
inflation at the 2 per cent target and the economy operating near
its production capacity. The Bank continues to judge that the econ-
omy is operating slightly below its full production capacity.
After appreciating sharply in 2003 and 2004, the Canadian dol-
lar has been fluctuating in a range of around 80 to 83 cents U.S.
since the beginning of the year.
The Bank’s base-case projection calls for annualized growth of
about 2 1
/2 per cent in the first half of 2005 and 3 per cent in the
second half. Growth of about 3 1
/2 per cent is expected over the
four quarters of 2006, consistent with returning the economy to
full production capacity in the second half of that year.
Expressed on an annual average basis, growth in 2005 is pro-
jected to be about 2 1
/2 per cent, down slightly from the January
Update, while the projection for 2006 is little changed at about
3 1/4 per cent.
We continue to expect core inflation to move back to the 2 per
cent target around the end of 2006. Based on the scenario implied
by oil-price futures, total
CPI inflation is projected to remain
slightly above 2 per cent this year and to move slightly below
2 per cent in the second half of 2006.

rate since the October

Growth in the Canadian economy this year and next is antici-
pated to come primarily from domestic demand, as net exports are
expected to exert a drag on the economy. To continue to support
aggregate demand, the Bank decided to leave the target for the
overnight rate unchanged at 2.5 per cent on 1 March and 12 April.
In line with the Bank’s outlook, a reduction of monetary stimulus
will be required over time.
The global and Canadian economic outlooks remain subject to
both upside and downside risks and to uncertainties. These risks
include the pace of expansion in Asia, and the prices of oil and
non-energy commodities. A further risk relates to the resolution of
current account imbalances, with the risk of a disorderly correc-
tion growing over time, should these imbalances persist.
Most of the uncertainties with respect to the Canadian outlook
continue to relate to how the economy is adjusting to the relative
price changes associated with major global developments.

2. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN INFLATION
Core inflation has
fluctuated in a range
of 1.5 to 1.8 per cent.
In the past year, core CPI inflation has been relatively stable,
fluctuating in a range of 1.5 to 1.8 per cent. The surge in crude oil
prices since the end of 2003 has pushed the average rate of
increase in the total CPI to slightly more than 2 per cent over the
same period.
Inflation and the 2 per cent target
The core rate of inflation moved up to 1.8 per cent in February
from 1.5 per cent in August 2004, still below the Bank’s 2 per cent
inflation-control target. (Chart 2).1 This is virtually the same as the
rise projected in the January Update. Other measures of the trend
rate of inflation that the Bank follows also remained below the
2 per cent target (Chart 3).
1. The core measure of inﬂation excludes the eight most volatile components
of the CPI and adjusts the remaining components to remove the effect of
changes in indirect taxes. The eight most volatile components are fruit, vege-
tables, gasoline, fuel oil, natural gas, intercity transportation, tobacco, and
mortgage-interest costs.

The modest amount of excess supply in the Canadian economy
through much of 2003 and 2004 contributed to keeping the core
rate slightly below longer-run expectations. Further reductions in
the prices of many import-intensive goods, caused by the appreci-
ation of the Canadian dollar and ongoing decreases in the global
prices of some consumer goods, also continued to put downward
pressure on core inflation over the period. The rate of increase in
homeowners’ replacement costs, an important component of core
prices for shelter, has also eased somewhat since July 2004 as a
result of lower year-over-year increases in the prices of new hous-
ing. Fluctuations in car prices, reflecting changes in manufactur-
ers’ incentives programs, explain much of the short-term variation
in core inflation observed since mid-2004.
The rate of increase in the
total CPI has averaged
just above 2 per cent
since August 2004.
Since last August, the 12-month rate of increase in the total CPI
was, on average, just above 2 per cent. The higher rate of increase
relative to the core rate chiefly reflected the impact of substantial
increases in the prices of energy commodities on selected CPI com-
ponents. In particular, in February there were substantial increases
in consumer prices for gasoline, fuel oil, natural gas, and intercity
transportation from year-earlier levels.

Factors at work on inflation
Aggregate demand
Economic growth in the
fourth quarter was
weaker than expected.
Canada’s real GDP grew at an annual rate of 2.9 per cent in the
third quarter of 2004, as expected in the October Report (Chart 4).
In the fourth quarter, economic growth eased to an annual rate of
1.7 per cent. This was less than anticipated in both the last Report
and the January Update. For the second half of the year as a whole,
exports were markedly weaker than projected, although this was
partly offset by unexpectedly large inventory investment. Eco-
nomic growth is likely to be on the order of 2 1
/2 per cent in the
first quarter of 2005.
Exports fell back in the
second half of 2004, partly
in response to the earlier
rise in the Canadian
dollar.
Final domestic demand continued to rise substantially in the
second half of 2004, and inventory investment rose markedly in
response to this robust growth and to concerns about delivery
lags. In contrast, the volume of net exports fell back (Chart 5).
Canadian exports decreased sharply in the second half of 2004.
Although a good part of this decline reflected an unwinding of the
surprising surge recorded in the first half, it more fundamentally
represented the ongoing adjustment to the past appreciation of the
Canadian dollar. That adjustment has been most evident in those
export
components
characterized
by
product
differentiation
(Chart 6). Indeed, in the second half of last year, export volumes
of machinery and equipment and non-automotive consumer goods

relative to indicators of foreign activity resumed the steep decline
that began in 2003. In contrast, exports of commodities relative to
U.S. industrial production, while fluctuating over the course of
2004, were little changed at year-end from 2003 levels. Exports of
automotive products were also little changed over the course of
last year relative to U.S. indicators of activity for the motor vehicle
sector.
Among the components of final domestic demand, the pace of
business
investment
picked
up
markedly
towards
year-end.
Household spending also rose considerably, owing to monetary
stimulus and ongoing gains in real incomes.
Part of the increase in final domestic demand was met by sub-
stantial gains in imports. The rise in inventory investment also
contributed to boost imports. Some of the marked rise in import
volumes relative to indicators of domestic activity, especially for
such items as machinery and equipment and crude and fabricated
materials, reflected the impact of the higher Canadian dollar, as
well as growing competition from low-cost emerging markets
(Chart 7).2
2. Imports are still estimated to have been below their long-run fundamental
level at the end of 2004, since only part of their adjustment to the substantial
cumulative appreciation of the Canadian dollar had been completed. How-
ever, further econometric work on imports, involving the replacement of an
aggregate income variable by individual components of demand, suggests
that the size of the gap relative to long-term fundamental levels is considera-
bly smaller than that shown in Technical Box 3 of the October Report.

Adjusting to global change
There are more indica-
tions of the adjustments
being made in response
to major global
developments . . .
The Canadian economy is continuing to adjust to major global
developments. These include a marked realignment of world cur-
rencies, including the Canadian dollar; high price levels for crude
oil and non-energy commodities; and the growing global eco-
nomic impact of China and India. Since the October Report, there
have been more indications of the sectoral effects of these global
developments and of firms’ responses to these changes.
The strong global economic expansion boosted profitability for
most of the industries with high exposure to international trade in
the first three quarters of 2004 (Chart 8).3 In the fourth quarter of
last year, however, profitability eased off in many of these indus-
tries, following a reduction in the global demand for Canadian
products and a further appreciation of the Canadian dollar from
the middle of 2004. As a result, there was only marginal growth in
the overall level of activity in sectors highly exposed to interna-
tional competition from August 2004 to January 2005. In contrast,
most sectors with a low exposure to foreign competition—such as
housing, retail and wholesale trade, and finance, insurance and
real estate—made further solid gains in output. Some of these sec-
tors also benefited from lower costs for imported products.
3. Net exposure to international trade is calculated by adding the proportion
of production that is exported and the share of imports in domestic consump-
tion, and subtracting the share of imported inputs in production. If a sector’s
net exposure to international trade ratio was at least 0.5 in 2001, then that sec-
tor is deﬁned as being highly exposed to international trade or competition.

These global economic developments can be expected to lead
to important shifts in the composition of activity among the broad
sectors of the Canadian economy. One important channel through
which this takes place is major shifts in capital spending at the
sectoral level in response to expected persistent changes in profita-
bility.
. . . as is evident in the
sectoral composition of
business investment
spending.
Consistent with this, the largest cumulative gains in actual and
planned capital spending for 2004 and 2005 occurred in commod-
ity-producing industries in response to the substantial rebound in
global commodity prices and the expectation that these price gains
would persist for some time (Table 1). Increases in investment
expenditures are particularly pronounced in oil and natural gas
extraction, other mining activity, and in the manufacture of wood
products.
The
substantial
gains
in
Canada’s
final
domestic
demand in recent years have also led to a marked rise in capital
spending in many sectors with a low exposure to international
trade, especially electric power generation, finance and insurance,
information and cultural industries, and the manufacture of
refined petroleum products. Moreover, in many of the sectors
either producing commodities or with a low exposure to interna-
tional trade, a large part of the increase in capital spending is
directed at expanding capacity.
In contrast, there is likely to be prolonged downward pressure
on profitability in many industries highly exposed to international
competition (other than those producing energy and other com-
modities), primarily because of the Canadian dollar’s appreciation
and growing competition from such economies as China and
India. As a result, investment spending in these industries seems
to be directed at reducing costs and improving competitiveness
rather than at increasing capacity.

More broadly, the Bank’s Business Outlook Surveys have shown
that many firms adversely affected by global developments are
taking various measures to improve productivity and reduce
costs. For instance, an increasing number of producers are choos-
ing to cut costs by importing more inputs from Asia. Others are
adjusting to the higher Canadian dollar by phasing out production
of goods and services with low profit margins and concentrating
on those with higher returns.
The adjustments being made by firms in response to global
economic developments also continued to be reflected in the secto-
ral composition of employment changes. Employment has tended
to rise since the end of 2003 in those industries producing com-
modities or having low exposure to foreign competition. On the
other hand, employment has fallen in the other manufacturing
industries highly exposed to international trade, reflecting to some
extent the substitution of capital for labour in order to reduce
costs. The spring Business Outlook Survey indicates that employ-
ment growth over the next 12 months will be concentrated in serv-
ice industries.
This reallocation of capital and labour involves adjustment
costs that may cause a temporary slowdown in productivity
growth and, therefore, in the growth of potential output. (See
Technical Box 1.)
Estimated pressures on capacity
The level of economic activity at the end of 2004 was broadly
in line with the Bank’s expectations in the January Update. While
output growth in the fourth quarter of 2004 was somewhat lower
than expected, this was largely offset by upward revisions to Sta-
tistics Canada’s estimates of growth earlier in the year. At the
same time, the Bank’s conventional measure of potential output
for 2004 was revised down slightly relative to the estimate used in
the January Update.4 As a result, the Bank’s conventional measure
of the output gap indicated that the economy was operating at
about its capacity limits in the fourth quarter of 2004, instead of
slightly below its effective capacity, as in the last Update (Chart 9).
Other indicators point to greater pressure on capacity than the
conventional measure. For instance, capacity utilization in the
non-farm, goods-producing sector in the fourth quarter of 2004
remained considerably higher than its average for 2000 to 2003,
because growth of capacity in this sector has been relatively low in
recent years, owing to weak investment spending and some write-
off of uneconomic capacity as a result of relative price changes.
4. Potential output is now estimated to have increased at an annual rate of
2.7 per cent in 2004, compared with a rise of 2.9 per cent in the Update.

Technical Box 1
Economic Adjustment and Productivity Growth
The Canadian economy has been adjusting to significant global developments,
such as the realignment of world currencies, including the Canadian dollar, and the
surge in commodity prices. These shocks are largely structural in nature and will
lead to a reallocation of capital and labour away from the production of non-
commodity manufactured goods towards the production of primary materials and
non-tradable goods and services. This reallocation will take some time, however,
and productivity growth could be lower during the adjustment period.
Before making adjustments to their workforce, firms often wait to ensure that
the shock is permanent. Workers with skills tied to a particular industry may
require retraining or other assistance to become fully functional in areas of the
economy that are expanding. They may have to relocate, and, once on the job, it
may take time for new staff to develop the firm-specific skills often associated with
productivity gains. Thus, major sectoral shifts in the allocation of labour will
initially tend to dampen productivity growth.
With respect to capital, there are typically lags between the decision to invest,
the acquisition of capital, and its integration into the production process, either to
expand capacity or to make the production process more efficient. When invest-
ment is in the form of machinery and equipment rather than structures, adjustment
costs are an important consideration. For example, in spite of the substantial invest-
ment in information and communications technologies (ICT) in the past decade,
productivity growth initially remained sluggish, especially outside the ICT produc-
tion sector. This is because it takes more than physical investment in new technolo-
gies to generate widespread productivity gains. Firms must train workers to use
new technologies or wait for newly trained graduates. Businesses may also have to
reorganize their workplaces to benefit fully from new technologies. These adjust-
ment costs will temporarily lower measured output, and thus productivity growth,
until the adjustment period is over. The lag between investment in new technology
and its payoff in terms of greater productivity growth could extend to a few years.

Nevertheless, it is important to note that several indicators
currently suggest more economic slack than is implied by the con-
ventional measure. On average, the core rate of inflation has been
below the 2 per cent midpoint of the target range since mid-2003.
As well, wage increases have remained quite moderate, and the
proportion of firms reporting labour shortages or difficulties in
meeting an unanticipated increase in demand was lower than
average in the spring Business Outlook Survey.
The degree of economic slack varies across industries and regions
because of the ongoing process of adjusting to global changes. But
what matters for monetary policy is the economy as a whole.
The Bank judges that the
output gap is somewhat
larger than suggested by
its conventional measure.
Based on an assessment of all the indicators of capacity pres-
sures, including those from the Business Outlook Survey, the Bank
judges that there is slightly more excess supply in the Canadian
economy than suggested by its conventional measure (Chart 10).
This view of the current size of the output gap is similar to that
held in the January Update.

Cost control and output prices
The underlying rate of increase in wages, based on such measures
as the average hourly earnings of permanent workers, appears to
have remained in a range between 2 1/4 and 3 1/4 per cent since
the middle of 2004 (Chart 11). The year-to-year gain in another
wage measure—hourly labour compensation in the business sec-
tor—was somewhat lower, at 2 per cent at the end of last year.
These overall figures mask important regional differences. For
example, in Western Canada, wage gains have generally been
higher than in the rest of the country, reflecting a greater preva-
lence of labour shortages in that region.
Unit labour costs in the
fourth quarter rose by just
under 2 per cent from
year-earlier levels.
With only a slight increase in productivity over the past year,
unit labour costs in the business sector in the fourth quarter of
2004 rose by just under 2 per cent from year-earlier levels (Chart 12).
Indeed, productivity growth was surprisingly low in both 2003
and 2004, easing markedly from its average performance over the
1998 to 2002 period.5 That reduction in productivity growth was
broadly based across sectors and stands in sharp contrast to the
U.S. experience.6 The assumption about the pace of productivity
growth embodied in the Bank’s outlook is discussed in Section 4.

growth for 2003 and 2004 are preliminary and are subject to revision as more
reliable benchmark data become available.
6. It is doubtful that the type of adjustment costs reviewed in Technical Box 1
accounted for a signiﬁcant part of the reported slowdown.

Income growth was
boosted by an improve-
ment in the terms of trade.
With substantial increases in the global prices for Canadian
exports of energy commodities and many industrial materials,
Canada’s terms of trade improved considerably in 2004.7 As a
result, the chain price index for GDP (a broad price measure of the
goods and services produced in Canada) rose 4.2 per cent between
the
fourth
quarter
of
2003
and
the
fourth
quarter
of
2004
(Chart 13). By comparison, the prices of goods and services pur-
chased by Canadians rose 2 per cent over the same period. This
terms-of-trade
improvement
has
thus
produced
a
significant
increase in real income, which has been reflected in the growth of
corporate profits and government tax revenues.
The price of crude oil has increased further since the end of
2004, reflecting upward revisions to the projected global demand
for oil and downward revisions to expected non-OPEC supplies.
The prices of non-energy commodities have also risen since the
end of 2004 (Chart 14). Strengthening demand has contributed to
recoveries in the prices of both lumber and pulp. At the same
time, continued strong global demand, as well as a number of
planned production cutbacks, have led to a further rise in metals
prices.
7. Over the past three years, Canada’s terms of trade have risen by just over
16 per cent.

3. FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Global financial condi-
tions have remained very
favourable . . .
For both the global economy and for Canada, financial condi-
tions have remained very favourable since the October Report.
Yields and credit spreads on corporate bonds are close to histori-
cally low levels. Equity markets have improved over recent
months,
and
market
volatility
has
remained
low.
Sustained
improvement in the balance sheets of Canadian banks, aggressive
competition among suppliers of credit, and modest demand for
credit have led to continued easing in bank-lending conditions in
Canada. Mainly because of strong supply conditions, growth in
business credit continues to pick up. Meanwhile, both supply and
demand continue to support robust growth in household credit.
Credit conditions
. . . and are reflected in
business-credit conditions
in Canada.
Business-credit conditions are quite favourable, both in Can-
ada and internationally. In financial markets, the demand for
higher-yielding,
somewhat
riskier
products
remains
strong.
Demand is supported by fairly robust corporate earnings and the
low yields returned by government securities. This has contrib-
uted to high bond prices and relatively low credit spreads
(Chart 15).

Most equity markets have improved since the October Report,
with the TSX Composite Index increasing by about 10 per cent. Much of
the improvement in Canada reflects the strong performance of the
energy sector.
Both gross and net issues by corporations have shown solid
growth in Canada. Credit defaults have been at cyclical lows, and
the share of credit-rating upgrades in total credit-rating changes
continued to rise. The growth of business credit (Chart 16) cur-
rently stands close to its 10-year average. The pickup in short-term
business credit has continued, boosted by easier lending condi-
tions. Growth in long-term business credit (including income
trusts) has also remained robust since the October Report, helped
by a stable net issuance of bonds and equities. Most of the
increase in business credit has reportedly been channelled towards
general business operations and debt refinancing rather than
towards new investment.
Household credit has
continued to advance
at a rapid pace.
Household credit has continued to advance at a rapid pace
since the October Report, with both consumer credit and residen-
tial mortgage credit contributing to the increase (Chart 16). At the
same time, low interest rates and favourable labour market condi-
tions have helped ensure that household balance sheets remain
healthy. The elevated level of household credit growth is likely to
be associated with strong consumption in the first part of this
year.

Overall, there is a
considerable amount of
liquidity in the Canadian
and global economies.
In summary, a broad range of financial indicators point to a
considerable amount of liquidity in the global economy, as well as
in the Canadian economy.
Yield curves and the exchange rate
Markets anticipate
further increases in the
federal funds rate over the
remainder of the year . . .
The yield curve in the United States has moved higher since
the time of the October Report (Chart 17). It has also continued to
flatten, mainly driven by larger increases in short-term interest
rates. Futures prices indicate that markets anticipate further
increases in the federal funds rate over the remainder of the year,
with U.S. forward rates implying a policy rate of approximately
4.0 per cent by the end of December 2005.
. . . and more gradual
increases in Canada’s
policy rate.
Canadian asset prices indicate expectations of a more gradual
trajectory for increases in interest rates here than in the United
States. This divergence in the expected paths for policy rates in the
two countries has contributed to sharply declining interest rate
differentials across the yield curve. Yields on two-year Canadian
bonds are now approximately 60 basis points below those on U.S.
Treasuries, and yield spreads on longer-term bonds have turned
negative for the first time in over four years.

The Canadian dollar has
traded within a range of
80 to 83 cents U.S.
After appreciating sharply from the time of the October Report
until early December, major currencies weakened against the
U.S. dollar, and the Canadian dollar has traded within a range of
80 to 83 cents U.S. This has occurred within the context of rising
U.S. interest rates, relative economic weakness in Japan and Europe,
rising energy prices, and generally high prices for other commodities.

4.THE OUTLOOK
International background
The global outlook is
little changed from
October . . .
On balance, the global economy has been performing largely
as expected at the time of the October Report, and growth is pro-
jected to remain relatively strong, at around 4 per cent in both
2005 and 2006, in spite of higher oil prices. While the overall
growth picture for the next two years has changed little from the
October Report, the distribution of growth is more uneven among
major economies than previously expected, with upward revisions
to the already strong growth prospects in non-Japan Asia offset-
ting downward adjustments to the growth outlook in Japan and
the European Union (Table 2).
. . . with momentum in the
United States remaining
strong.
Recent economic developments in the United States suggest
that underlying momentum remains strong. Real GDP grew at an
annual rate of 4 per cent in the third quarter of 2004 and 3.8 per
cent in the fourth quarter. Consumer spending and business
investment were both very robust in the second half of the year.
Despite the significant real effective depreciation of the U.S. dollar,
net exports continued to restrain growth in the second half of
2004. Evidence to date indicates that growth remained near 4 per
cent in the first quarter of 2005.

The U.S. economy is expected to post growth rates that will be
somewhat above potential in 2005 and 2006, albeit lower than
in 2004. As a result, excess supply (estimated at somewhat below
1 per cent of GDP at the end of 2004) should be largely eliminated
over the next two years. Business investment should remain solid,
since the capital stock appears unusually low at this point in the
cycle. Moreover, the past depreciation of the U.S. dollar should
contribute to a strong recovery in export growth. Meanwhile,
household expenditures are likely to slow, partly because of the
dampening impact of higher oil prices and of past and anticipated
increases in interest rates.
Growth in China remains
buoyant . . .
At the same time, the contribution of Asia (excluding Japan) to
the world economic expansion is slightly greater than previously
expected. In particular, growth in China has remained surprisingly
buoyant despite the implementation of administrative tightening
measures and higher domestic interest rates. Accordingly, the out-
look calls for a more gradual slowing profile than was assumed at
the time of the October Report.
. . . while that in Japan
is projected to be lower
than earlier expected.
In contrast, growth in Japan turned out to be weaker than
anticipated.8 Following a sharp rise in the first quarter of 2004, real
GDP was relatively stagnant throughout the remainder of the year,
owing largely to the impact of an inventory correction in IT-related sec-
tors, higher oil prices, and typhoons. A gradual pickup in quarterly
growth throughout 2005 is expected, as the effect of the adverse
factors that restrained aggregate demand in the latter part of 2004
diminishes. Nevertheless, the average annual growth rate in 2005
should be significantly lower than in 2004, owing to the low start-
ing point.
In the euro area, real economic activity in the final quarter of
2004 was also weaker than anticipated, and the outlook has been
revised down marginally. A gradual pickup in the rate of growth
of economic activity is expected this year and next, as the adverse
impact stemming from the past appreciation of the euro and the
rise in world oil prices gradually tapers off.
Global imbalances
remain a key risk.
While the overall global short-term outlook is favourable, a
number of risks and uncertainties remain, including the future
course of oil prices, the pace of expansion in China, and geopoliti-
cal developments. A key risk relates to the unfolding of current
account imbalances, with the risk of a disorderly correction grow-
ing over time if the imbalances persist. Indeed, despite a substan-
tial real effective depreciation of the U.S. dollar since early 2002,9
external imbalances have continued to widen and are likely to
8. This partly reﬂects revisions to national accounts that have resulted in a
much lower growth proﬁle.
9. The depreciation of the U.S. dollar between February 2002 and March 2005
amounted to 15 per cent, according to the U.S. Federal Reserve Board’s real
effective broad index.
 M O N E T A R Y  P O L I C Y  R E P O R T — A P R I L  2 0 0 5
27
continue to do so in the near term. An orderly correction of exter-
nal imbalances will require increased savings in the United States,
a strengthening of demand elsewhere, notably in Japan and
Europe, combined with further real effective depreciation of the
U.S. dollar. Greater exchange rate flexibility in Asia would facili-
tate the adjustment.
The assumed scenario
for oil prices is now
markedly higher.
The projected global economic expansion should help maintain
the U.S.-dollar prices of non-energy commodities at relatively high
levels over the remainder of 2005 and through 2006, although
some easing is likely as new supplies become available (Technical
Box 2). On the other hand, any further real depreciation of the U.S.
dollar would put upward pressure on non-energy commodity
prices, expressed in U.S.-dollar terms. With regard to crude oil, the
Bank’s base-case scenario—which is based on recent futures prices
(Chart 19)—assumes that prices will be close to US$57 per barrel
over the remainder of 2005 and then ease slightly to about
US$54 per barrel by the second half of 2006. Natural gas prices are
expected to stay at relatively high levels through 2006. The Bank’s
base-case scenario for oil prices is markedly higher than in the
January Update.

Technical Box 2
Emerging Asia: Implications for Canada
Over the past 25 years, emerging markets in Asia have been a growing source of
global trade, with China becoming a dominant economic force in the region in the
past few years.1 By 2003, these economies accounted for 16 per cent of global trade,
up from just 6 per cent in 1980. Although Canada’s direct trade with the region is lim-
ited, the region’s trade significantly affects Canada through global markets. Of partic-
ular importance is the region’s growing demand for commodities and the resultant
impact on global commodity prices.
Although Asian demand for commodities temporarily collapsed with the Asian
crisis in 1997–98, the ensuing regional recovery and the growing economic promi-
nence of China have led to a resurgence of demand and sharply higher prices.
According to the Bank of Canada’s index, commodity prices have risen by over 70 per
cent in terms of G-7 currencies since mid-November 2001. This increase has been a
significant factor behind the 25 per cent rise in the value of the Canadian dollar over
the past two years.
The strong Chinese demand for commodities reflects very robust domestic invest-
ment, as well as the country’s growing role as a manufacturing platform for Asian
firms. Although China is itself a major producer of many commodities, its rapid eco-
nomic growth has caused domestic demand to outstrip domestic supply, leading the
country to become a major buyer on international commodity markets.
Canadian natural-resource producers are well positioned to take advantage of
these favourable market conditions. Robust global demand has resulted in strong cor-
porate profitability despite the appreciation of the Canadian dollar. In response,
resource producers have increased their investment expenditures, which suggests that
Canadian firms are planning to expand production. Firms outside the resources sector
are also paying closer attention to China as an important new market.

Aggregate demand and supply in Canada
GDP growth in Canada is
projected to be about
2 1/2 per cent in 2005 and
about 3 1/4 per cent
in 2006 . . .
Given the effects of the past and recent appreciation of the
Canadian dollar, the Bank expects growth, on an average annual
basis, of about 2 1
/2 per cent in 2005. Growth should pick up to
about 3 1/4 per cent in 2006. The Bank’s outlook for growth
in 2005 is slightly lower than projected in the January Update,
reflecting weaker-than-expected growth in the fourth quarter of
2004. Projected quarterly growth through the year, however, is
unchanged from the January Update. While the Bank’s growth pro-
jection for 2005 is the same as the latest Consensus outlook, the
projection for 2006 is slightly higher.
. . . with the economy
returning to its produc-
tion capacity in the
second half of 2006.
The Bank’s projection assumes real GDP growth of 2 1
/2 per
cent, at an annual rate, during the first half of 2005. This is
expected to move up to about 3 per cent in the second half of this
year and to about 3 1
/2 per cent over the four quarters of 2006.
The lower rate of growth projected for the first half of 2005 stems
mainly from the anticipated slowing in the rate of inventory accu-
mulation. This outlook for growth implies a modest rise in excess
supply in the first half of 2005 and a return to production capacity
in the second half of 2006.
Were it to persist, the sluggish growth in labour productivity
in the past two years would put the Bank’s projection for potential
output growth at risk. However, recent and projected increases
in business investment, as well as continued rapid growth in
labour productivity in the United States, make it reasonable to
assume a resumption of productivity growth. In addition, there
may be some upside risks to the trend rate of growth of labour
inputs, at least over the near term. Therefore, at this time, the
Bank continues to project growth in production capacity of 3 per
cent. This is based on the assumptions of trend growth of 1 1
/4 per
cent in labour inputs and trend growth of 1 3/4 per cent in labour
productivity.
Economic expansion is
expected to be supported
primarily by growth in
final domestic demand . . .
Economic expansion in Canada this year and next is expected
to be supported primarily by the continued substantial growth of
final
domestic
demand
(Table 3).
This
view
is
essentially
unchanged from that of the January Update. As noted earlier, there
is still considerable monetary stimulus supporting demand at this
time. The Bank’s outlook continues to incorporate a reduction of
monetary stimulus over the projection period.
Capital spending by businesses is projected to increase even
more strongly than last year, reflecting the global economic expan-
sion and the associated high levels of prices for both energy and
non-energy commodities, very favourable financial conditions,
high profit levels, and further decreases in the prices of imported
machinery and equipment. Ongoing gains in real incomes, the

effects of monetary stimulus, and the high level of consumer
confidence (Chart 20) should contribute to further solid growth in
consumer spending. However, following the rapid increases in
recent years, housing investment, on balance, is expected to
remain unchanged over this period. Spending on renovations is
projected to rise strongly, offsetting the impact of anticipated
reductions in housing starts and resale activity.
This outlook incorporates the expectations that spending by all
levels of government will rise at about the same rate as revenues,
as governments continue to work to maintain fiscal balance.
. . . which is projected to
be partly offset by the
drag on net exports aris-
ing from the past appreci-
ation of the Canadian
dollar.
Further economic growth abroad, especially in the United
States, should lead to increased demand for Canadian exports.
However, this is expected to be more than offset by rapid growth
in imports in both 2005 and 2006. The past appreciation of the
Canadian dollar is expected to continue to dampen the growth of
Canada’s exports and to boost import growth over the projection
period. As well, imports will be boosted by strong investment in
machinery and equipment.
In the January Update, the high level of oil prices was expected
to have a slight adverse effect on aggregate demand in Canada
in 2005, before the positive impact on investment and produc-
tion in the energy sector became evident in 2006. Given the markedly

higher outlook for oil prices in this Report, the downside pres-
sure on demand for Canadian exports and on household spend-
ing is likely to be somewhat larger than expected in the last
Update.
However,
stronger-than-expected
growth
in
capital
spending by energy producers, based on recent investment inten-
tions, should more than offset that negative effect by 2006.
Measures of inflation expectations
Most measures of
inflation expectations
are little changed.
Most indicators of inflation expectations that the Bank follows
have been little changed since mid-October, and many of the key
medium- and longer-term measures remain very close to 2 per
cent. In the regular survey reported in the winter issue of the Con-
ference Board of Canada’s Index of Business Confidence, 74 per cent
of respondents expected prices, in general, to rise over the next six
months at a rate of 2 per cent or less, virtually unchanged from
last autumn. However, even though 93 per cent of firms in the
Bank’s spring Business Outlook Survey expected CPI inflation to be
within a range of 1 to 3 per cent, on average, over the next two
years, 60 per cent of respondents expected inflation to be in the
upper part of the range. On the other hand, the average private
sector forecast for total CPI inflation in both 2005 and 2006 is just
under 2 per cent. Consensus forecasts of inflation for 2007 and
beyond also continue to be very close to 2 per cent.

Other factors affecting inflation
There remains a risk that the higher costs arising from the per-
sistently high level of the global prices of energy and other raw
materials could be passed through to the prices of non-energy
goods and services. Indeed, there is some anecdotal evidence that
part of the sharply higher costs of some metals is raising the
prices of some durable goods, such as major appliances. The most
recent experience, however, suggests that this pass-through effect
is likely to be relatively small and spread out over time.
In contrast, the appreciation of the Canadian dollar since early
2003 is expected to be a continuing source of slight downward
pressure on core inflation during the projection period. There also
appear to be ongoing reductions in the world prices of some con-
sumer goods as a result of increasing supplies from countries such
as China.
Increases in average hourly earnings of permanent workers are
expected to move up somewhat through 2006. Nevertheless, with
labour-productivity
growth
anticipated
to
resume
over
this
period, year-to-year gains in unit labour costs should remain at or
below 2 per cent through the projection period.
Implications of money growth
Growth in the narrow money aggregates—M1+ and M1++—
has slowed since the last Report (Chart 21) and is broadly consistent

with projected output growth of slightly above 2 per cent in the
first quarter of 2005.
Since the October Report, the growth of M2++ has stabilized at
just under 6 per cent on a year-over-year basis, despite the
strength in the narrow money aggregates over the same period.
This rate of growth for M2++ is consistent with inflation under
2 per cent (Chart 22).
Inflation projection
Core inflation is expected
to stay near 1.7 per cent
for the rest of 2005 . . .
The small amount of excess supply projected for the Canadian
economy should keep core inflation slightly below longer-run
expectations through 2005 and most of 2006. The past and recent
appreciation of the Canadian dollar is also expected to exert a
small amount of downward pressure on the core rate during this
period.
. . . before moving up to
2 per cent around the end
of 2006.
The core rate of inflation is projected to stay near 1.7 per cent
through to the end of 2005. With the economy expected to move
back to its production potential in the second half of 2006 and
with inflation expectations remaining well anchored, the core rate
should rise gradually to 2 per cent around the end of 2006
(Table 4).

Total CPI inflation is
expected to stay above
2 per cent into 2006.
The outlook for the 12-month rate of increase in the total CPI
will continue to be crucially affected by developments in the mar-
ket for crude oil. Based on the scenario embodied in oil-price
futures (Chart 19), total CPI inflation is projected to stay above
2 per cent for some time, before moving down slightly below 2 per
cent in the second half of 2006.
