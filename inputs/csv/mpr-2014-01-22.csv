Canada’s Inﬂ
ation-Control Strategy1
Infl
ation targeting and the economy
• the Bank’s mandate is to conduct monetary policy to pro-
mote the economic and ﬁ
nancial well-being of Canadians .
• Canada’s experience with infl
ation targeting since 1991
has shown that the best way to foster conﬁ
dence in the
value of money and to contribute to sustained economic
"growth, employment gains and improved living standards"
is by keeping infl
"ation low, stable and predictable ."
"• In 2011, the Government and the Bank of Canada renewed"
Canada’s infl
ation-control target for a further ﬁ
ve-year
"period, ending 31 december 2016 . the target, as measured"
"by the total consumer price index (CPI), remains at the"
2 per cent midpoint of the control range of 1 to 3 per cent .
The monetary policy instrument
• the Bank carries out monetary policy through changes
in the target overnight rate of interest .2 these changes
are transmitted to the economy through their infl
uence
"on market interest rates, domestic asset prices and the"
"exchange rate, which aﬀ"
ect total demand for Canadian
goods and services . the balance between this demand
"and the economy’s production capacity is, over time, the"
primary determinant of infl
ation pressures in the economy .
• Monetary policy actions take time—usually from six to
eight quarters—to work their way through the economy
and have their full eﬀ
ect on infl
"ation . for this reason,"
monetary policy must be forward looking .
"• Consistent with its commitment to clear, transparent"
"communications, the Bank regularly reports its perspec-"
tive on the forces at work on the economy and their
implications for infl
ation . the Monetary Policy Report is a
key element of this approach . Policy decisions are typi-
"cally announced on eight pre-set days during the year,"
"and full updates of the Bank’s outlook, including risks to"
"the projection, are published four times per year in the"
Monetary Policy Report .
Infl
ation targeting is symmetric and ﬂ
exible
• Canada’s infl
"ation-targeting approach is symmetric, which"
means that the Bank is equally concerned about infl
ation
rising above or falling below the 2 per cent target .
• Canada’s infl
ation-targeting framework is ﬂ
exible .
"typically, the Bank seeks to return infl"
ation to target over
"a horizon of six to eight quarters . However, the most"
appropriate horizon for returning infl
ation to target will
vary depending on the nature and persistence of the
shocks buﬀ
eting the economy .
Monitoring infl
ation
"• In the short run, a good deal of movement in the CPI is"
caused by fl
uctuations in the prices of certain volatile
"components (e .g ., fruit and gasoline) and by changes in"
"indirect taxes . for this reason, the Bank also monitors a"
set of “core” infl
"ation measures, most importantly the"
"CPIX, which strips out eight of the most volatile CPI com-"
ponents and the eﬀ
ect of indirect taxes on the remaining
components . these “core” measures allow the Bank to
“look through” temporary price movements and focus on
the underlying trend of infl
"ation . In this sense, core infl"
a-
tion is monitored as an operational guide to help the Bank
achieve the total CPI infl
ation target . It is not a replace-
ment for it .
1 See Joint Statement of the Government of Canada and the Bank of Canada on the Renewal of the Inﬂ
ation-Control Target (8 november 2011) and
Renewal of the Inﬂ
"ation-Control Target: Background Information—November 2011, which are both available on the Bank’s website ."
"2 When interest rates are at the zero lower bound, additional monetary easing to achieve the infl"
ation target can be provided through three unconven-
tional instruments: (i) a conditional statement on the future path of the policy rate; (ii) quantitative easing; and (iii) credit easing . these instruments
and the principles guiding their use are described in the annex to the april 2009 Monetary Policy Report .

"“As our inflation target is symmetric, we care about both the"
"upside and downside risks to inflation. Of course, when"
"we are already below target, as we are today, we care"
more about downside risks than upside ones.”

Global Economy
"Global economic growth is expected to strengthen over the next two years,"
led by stronger momentum in the United States (Table 1 and Chart 1). In con-
"trast, in the euro area, GDP growth will be modest as further private delever-"
aging and high unemployment continue to weigh on domestic demand. In
"Japan, exceptional monetary policy stimulus is projected to sustain the"
"ongoing recovery, despite scheduled increases in the value-added tax."

"China’s real GDP is anticipated to grow at a more moderate, though still"
"solid, pace over the projection horizon, with a gradual rebalancing toward"
consumption and away from investment and exports. Economic activity in
"other emerging-market economies (EMEs) is projected to pick up, owing to a"
"normalization of financial conditions, more robust growth in foreign demand"
and further progress on economic reforms.
"While global trade growth has plunged since 2011 (Chart 2), a recovery is"
"expected over the projection horizon, supported by growing international"
"demand. At the same time, the improvement in world economic activity"
"should help to sustain the elevated level of commodity prices. Overall, global"
economic growth is expected to rise from 2.9 per cent in 2013 to 3.4 per cent
in 2014 and 3.7 per cent in 2015.
Financial conditions in the advanced economies remain highly supportive of
economic growth. The decision by the U.S. Federal Open Market Committee
"(FOMC) to taper its asset purchases was well received in financial markets,"
compared with the outsized response in May 2013 to the initial indication that
asset purchases might be reduced (Chart 3). Reflecting expectations of stronger
"growth, especially in the United States, yields on long-term government bonds"
"in many advanced economies have increased (Chart 4), and risky assets have"
"performed well. Financial conditions in some EMEs remain challenging,"
"however, particularly in those economies with weak fundamentals. As U.S."
"monetary policy is normalized, there may be some overshooting in global bond"
"yields, which would lead to tighter global financial conditions and slower global"
growth.
"Inflation remains below target in most advanced economies, dampened by"
significant excess capacity. As economic slack is reduced and labour markets
"firm, inflation rates in these economies are projected to move up gradually."

The United States is expected to lead faster global growth
U.S. economic growth in the second half of 2013 is estimated to have
"rebounded to more than 3.5 per cent, on average, notwithstanding the"
"adverse effects of fiscal consolidation, higher long-term interest rates, and"
the added uncertainty caused by a temporary government shutdown and the
debt-ceiling standoff. There has since been an improvement in both household
"and business confidence, owing to the resolution of these fiscal issues and the"
stronger economic outlook. While the anticipated cumulative drag on growth
from fiscal policy over the next two years is largely unchanged relative to
"previous expectations, under the new agreement, it will be spread more"
evenly. Fiscal drag is now projected to decline from 1.7 percentage points in
2013 to 0.5 percentage points in 2014 and 0.3 percentage points in 2015.1
"Given the improvement in economic conditions, the U.S. FOMC has begun"
"to reduce the pace of its monthly asset purchases, with further reductions"
conditional on the outlook for labour market conditions and inflation. Monetary
"policy is expected to remain highly accommodative, however, and U.S."
financial conditions are very stimulative. Based on the FOMC’s recently
"revised forward guidance, policy interest rates are likely to remain at the"
current low levels well after the unemployment rate has declined below
6 1/2 per cent—especially if ­
projected inflation remains under the 2 per cent
"target. Equity prices have reached record levels, and yields on corporate"
"bonds are low, leading to robust issuance."
A projected broad-based acceleration in U.S. private demand over 2014−15
is expected to create a virtuous circle of self-sustaining growth. Growth in
"consumption is expected to pick up, supported by strengthening labour"
"market conditions, continued increases in household wealth and improved"
"access to credit. Even with higher mortgage interest rates, the recovery in"
the housing sector is projected to continue at a solid pace as bank lending
"conditions are eased, household formation rebounds and the stock of"
homes in foreclosure declines. In ­
"addition, the growth of business invest-"
"ment is anticipated to increase, given improving economic conditions and"
less uncertainty about fiscal policy. A robust rise in exports will likely be
"more than offset by an increase in non-oil imports, with net exports making"
a slightly negative ­
contribution to real GDP growth over the projection
horizon.
"Overall, U.S. real GDP growth is expected to rise from 1.9 per cent in 2013 to"
3.0 per cent in 2014 and 3.2 per cent in 2015. This growth profile is stronger
"than anticipated in the October Report, reflecting broad-based strength in U.S."
"private demand. Based on the past dispersion of private sector forecasts, U.S."
economic growth in 2014 would be expected to fall within ± 0.5 percentage
"points of the Bank’s projection, with a somewhat wider range in 2015. There"
"is a risk, however, that U.S. economic growth could surprise further on the"
upside if businesses increased investment spending more rapidly than pro-
jected in response to reduced policy uncertainty and a rekindling of “animal
spirits.” Such a scenario would have broad positive spillover effects on the
global economy.
"1	 In the October Monetary Policy Report, the fiscal drag was expected to amount to 1.8 percentage"
"points in 2013, and then to decline to 0.8 percentage points in 2014 and zero in 2015."

Inflation in the advanced economies has been declining
Inflation has been trending lower over the past two years in many advanced
"economies, in some cases falling well below target levels (Chart 5). This"
"generalized weakness likely reflects common international factors, such as"
"reductions in global food and energy prices, as well as the impact from still-"
sizable negative output gaps and high unemployment (Box 1).
The downward trend of inflation in the advanced economies is expected
"to reverse over the projection horizon. In the United States, strengthening"
growth is expected to reduce economic slack and move inflation closer to the
"2 per cent target toward the end of 2015. In Japan, core inflation has become"
positive for the first time in five years in response to aggressive monetary
"policy stimulus. It is expected to rise further over the projection horizon, with"
an anticipated increase in wages contributing importantly to this movement.
"Given the muted recovery in the euro area, the output gap will remain sizable,"
and the rise in inflation is expected to be limited.
"Compared with the advanced economies, inflation remains relatively high in"
"many EMEs, driven in part by exchange rate depreciations that have pushed"
"up import prices. The recent tightening in monetary policy in some EMEs,"
"combined with structural reforms that will help to relieve supply constraints,"
is projected to lead to a reduction in inflation in these economies.

The Bank of Canada’s commodity price index is expected
to remain elevated
"Commodity prices, as measured by the Bank of Canada’s commodity"
"price index (BCPI), are elevated (Chart 6). High commodity prices continue"
"to reflect the growing importance of China and other EMEs. In particular,"
China’s solid growth outlook and the size of its economy mean that the
"demand for commodities should continue to be robust.2 Moreover, ongoing"
urbanization and an expanding middle class in China and other EMEs are
expected to support commodity prices over the medium term.
"2	 In U.S.-dollar terms, China’s economy has doubled to roughly US$9 trillion in the past five years."
Box 1
Weak Infl
ation in Advanced Economies Remains a Concern
"over the past two years, total CPI infl"
ation in advanced econ-
"omies has slowed considerably, dropping by 1 .6 percentage"
points to reach 1 .5 per cent on average (on a year-over-year
basis) in november 2013 (Chart 1-A) . It is now below the
targets of central banks in most advanced economies . Core
infl
"ation has also fallen, but by a slightly smaller amount, and"
averages 1 .6 per cent on a year-over-year basis .
our analysis suggests that the weakness in total CPI infl
ation in
"advanced economies has a large, common international com-"
ponent that is likely associated with declines in global prices
for food and energy . the weakness in core infl
"ation, on the"
"other hand, is only partly explained by a common global factor,"
despite widespread excess capacity in the global economy
"since 2009 (Chart 1-B) . In this regard, it is somewhat puzz"
ling
that the rate of infl
ation has been declining only recently .1
It may be that infl
ation responds more to persistent output
"gaps, and with a considerable lag . Country-speciﬁ"
c factors
may also be important in explaining the recent movements in
core infl
ation . these factors vary across countries and include
"greater retail competition, the waning impact of previous"
"increases in taxes or regulated prices, and low wage pressures ."
1
Well-anchored infl
ation expectations and the high credibility of central banks
contributed to the relative stability of infl
ation throughout the crisis .

Summary
"The anticipated upturn in advanced and emerging-market economies, led"
"by the United States, is expected to result in an improved performance for"
Canada’s exports. Robust global demand for commodities is projected to
sustain the elevated level of investment in the resource sector in Canada
and to support Canadian income levels.
"The Canadian dollar has recently fallen to around 91 cents U.S., compared"
with the 97 cents U.S. assumed in the October Report (Chart 8). This
depreciation likely reflects the improved growth prospects in the United
"States, as well as reduced safe-haven effects that had pushed the Canadian"
"dollar higher in the aftermath of the global financial crisis. By convention,"
the Canadian dollar is assumed to remain at or near its current level over the
projection horizon.

Bank of Canada  •  Monetary Policy Report  •  January 2014
Canadian Economy
Inflation has moved further below the 2 per cent target in recent months.
The downward pressure on prices principally reflects a significant amount
of excess supply in the economy and heightened competition in the retail
sector. The effects of these factors appear to be greater than had been
"anticipated. At the same time, Canada’s economic growth strengthened in"
"the second half of 2013, and prospects have improved somewhat relative to"
"the October Report, given expectations of firmer growth in U.S. demand."
While as yet there are no signs of a rebalancing toward exports and business
"investment, the strengthening of the global economy and recent depreciation of"
the Canadian dollar should foster a broadening of the composition of growth in
Canada. As excess capacity is gradually absorbed and the effects of competi-
"tion wane, the Bank expects that inflation will return to 2 per cent in about two"
"years, although the profile of inflation is now lower than projected in October."
The Canadian economy is continuing to adjust to the aftermath of the global
"financial crisis and the ensuing recession, as well as to significantly higher"
global prices for Canada’s commodity exports compared with the 1990s
average. These large and persistent forces have had important sectoral and
"regional effects, and will continue to influence the composition of exports"
and business investment in coming years (Box 2).
The composition of growth is expected to broaden
Real GDP growth is estimated to have risen somewhat above the growth
"rate of potential output in the second half of 2013.3 However, the shift in the"
composition of aggregate demand necessary for sustainable growth has not
yet occurred. The moderate growth trend in consumer spending remained
"supportive of overall growth, while residential investment failed to slow to the"
"extent anticipated. At the same time, non-commodity exports continued to"
"disappoint, and business investment recovered more slowly than expected."
Excess capacity in the economy remains significant (Chart 9). Taking into
account the various indicators of capacity pressures and the uncertainty
"surrounding any point estimates, the Bank judges that the amount of"
excess supply in the fourth quarter of 2013 was between 3/4 per cent and
"1 3/4 per cent, slightly less than estimated in the October Report."
Real GDP growth is projected to rise from 1.8 per cent in 2013 to 2.5 per cent
"on an average annual basis in both 2014 and 2015, underpinned by the"
"ongoing firming in the U.S. economy, which will lead to more broadly based"
3	 Some of the increase reflects a rebound from the temporary factors that suppressed growth in the second
"quarter of 2013, when economic activity was depressed by the impact of flooding in southern Alberta and"
"the construction strike in Quebec. The temporary nature of these shocks, together with the reconstruction"
"and repair of damaged infrastructure in Alberta, has subsequently boosted real GDP growth."

Box 2
Forces Acting on the Canadian Economy
the outlook for the Canadian economy refl
ects its adjust-
ment to two large and persistent shocks: (i) the global
ﬁ
nancial
crisis and the ensuing Great recession (Chart 2-A); and (ii) a
signiﬁ
"cant improvement in Canada’s terms of trade (i .e ., the"
price of Canada’s exports relative to the price of imports) due
to higher global prices for many of the commodities Canada
exports (Chart 2-B) .1
the structural shift in the terms of trade is yielding beneﬁ
"ts,"
"since growth in the commodity-exporting sectors creates jobs,"
"stimulates interprovincial trade, and raises aggregate income"
"and wealth . In fact, gross domestic income is approximately"
7 per cent higher than it would have been without the improve-
"ment in the terms of trade since 2002 . as would be expected,"
the shift in the terms of trade is infl
uenc
ing the character of
"the recovery from the Great recession, and will continue to do"
so for some time:
•
The persistent strength of the Canadian dollar. Greater
demand and higher prices for the commodities that
Canada exports have supported the value of the
Canadian dollar (Chart 2-C) .2 despite depreciating in
"recent months, the Canadian dollar remains strong and"
will continue to pose competitiveness challenges for
Canada’s non-commodity exports .
1
Canada’s terms of trade have increased by 24 per cent since early 2002 . the Bank
estimates that approximately half of the improvement is due to commodities . the
remainder is largely attributable to a decline in the price of Canada’s non-com-
modity imports .
2 the Bank estimates that commodity prices account for roughly half of the appre-
ciation of the Canadian dollar since 2002 . the remainder of the appreciation is in
line with the broad-based depreciation of the U .S . dollar .
•
Sectoral realignment and two-speed recovery. Higher
commodity prices are bolstering the eﬀ
ects of the
"recovery by stimulating more activity, investment and"
"job growth in the natural resource sector (e .g ., energy"
"and mining) than in the non-resource sector (e .g ., manu-"
facturing) . this increased activity is drawing people
and capital from the non-
resource sector toward the
"resource sector; indeed, the fl"
exibility of Canada’s labour
market is facilitating interprovincial migration . a side
eﬀ
ect of this migration is more robust activity in housing
markets in regions that have received infl
ows .

somewhat wider range in 2015.4
"With foreign demand expected to strengthen, the Bank’s best judgment"

growth at the beginning of 2014. Total exports are projected to increase at a

Bank of Canada  •  Monetary Policy Report  •  January 2014
"all three major export groupings—energy-related commodities, non-energy"
"commodities and non-commodities—is expected to pick up, although"
commodity exports will contribute the most to growth in GDP. The stronger
performance in the trade sector should be supported by the depreciation of
the Canadian dollar in recent months.5 Sustained growth in exports should
stimulate improvements in business confidence and lead to a more solid
contribution from business fixed investment over time. Imports should also
"strengthen, given supply-chain linkages in the foreign trade sector and"
"the high import content of business investment, particularly investment in"
machinery and equipment.
The economy will continue to be supported by moderate growth in consumer
"spending, while the level of residential investment is expected to remain rela-"
"tively unchanged, commensurate with a convergence toward a more sustain-"
"able level of activity (Chart 10). Overall, recent developments are consistent"
with some degree of consumer caution and a soft landing of the housing
"market. Housing starts moderated in 2013 compared with 2012, particularly"
in regions that are not benefit­
ing directly from the energy sector and related
"interprovincial migration. In the anticipation of higher mortgage rates, there"
"was some pulling forward of house purchases over the summer. As expected,"
"this uptick was temporary, and sales of existing homes have since slowed to"
a level close to their historical average. House price growth also moderated
in 2013 relative to 2012 (Chart 11). Overall credit growth has firmed in recent
"months, largely reflecting the pickup in resale activity earlier in the year, but"
remains consistent with the Bank’s view that the ratio of household debt to
disposable income will stabilize over the projection horizon.
With the projected profile for the growth of real GDP exceeding the growth
"of potential output, the Bank expects that the economy will gradually return"
to its full production capacity over the next two years.6
5	 Two recently announced federal government initiatives should also provide support to Canadian
exports over coming years. The first is the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement between
"Canada and the European Union, which has yet to be implemented, and the second is the Global"
Markets Action Plan.
6	 The base-case economic projection is built around the midpoint of the output gap range in 2013Q4
"(i.e., about 1 1/4 per cent)."

Export and business investment growth is expected to
strengthen
Non-commodity exports have remained disappointingly weak in recent
"quarters, despite the strengthening U.S. economy over this period (Chart 12)."
"Ongoing competitiveness challenges, including competition in the U.S."
"market from emerging-market economies such as China and Mexico, may"
have played a greater role than previously estimated. Restructuring in global
supply chains is affecting global trade patterns and may also have contrib-
uted to the weakness in exports. Ongoing adjustments to the terms of trade
mean that commodity and non-commodity exports will continue to grow at
different rates over the projection horizon (Box 2).

The non-commodity sector is expected to benefit from a U.S.-led strength-
"ening in foreign demand, which appears more firmly entrenched than in"
October. A key assumption underlying the base-case projection is that
growth in the non-commodity sector will pick up gradually over the next
"two years, but will remain slower than the pace of growth of foreign demand"
"(Chart 13). While this assumption is prudent, there is a risk that the recovery"
"in non-commodity exports may take even longer than anticipated, given"
ongoing competitiveness challenges and potential supply constraints.
Energy exports have been hampered during the past year by temporary
production shutdowns and transportation bottlenecks (Chart 12). Growth in
"energy exports is expected to strengthen in 2014, reflecting announced plans"

"by major producers to increase output, the growing use of Canadian heavy"
oil in U.S. refineries and further growth in rail capacity. Exports of non-energy
"commodities, such as lumber products, are also expected to strengthen."
"As uncertainty about the outlook dissipates, competitiveness pressures to"
improve productivity and the need to expand capacity to meet sustained
increases in foreign demand are expected to lead to stronger business
investment. This should be the case particularly for investment in machinery
"and equipment, which has been held back by cyclical factors as well as"
adjustments of the manufacturing sector to the effects of the relatively high
terms of trade. These incentives to invest will add to those stemming from
the steady growth in domestic demand.
"Financial conditions in Canada remain supportive of investment, with strong"
investor demand reflected in relatively narrow corporate bond spreads and
"buoyant equity prices, suggesting confidence in the future profitability of the"
corporate sector. Responses to the Bank’s latest Senior Loan Officer Survey
and Business Outlook Survey also indicate that credit conditions remain
"favourable. Moreover, business credit growth remains above its historical"
"average, although it has slowed somewhat in recent months. Canadian firms"
"should also be more inclined to invest, since the lower value of the Canadian"
dollar is boosting both activity and profitability in the export sector.
There are some encouraging signs that confidence is gradually building
(Chart 14). Firms surveyed for the Bank’s latest Business Outlook Survey
point to improvements in the U.S. economic outlook and foreign orders and
to the benefits of their recent investments in bolstering their ability to export.
Intentions to invest in machinery and equipment have increased for the first
"time since the fourth quarter of 2012, although firms also report that invest-"
"ments are still depressed by uncertainty, notably with respect to domestic"
demand. The results of the latest survey conducted by Export Development

Subdued CPI inflation is expected to return slowly to target
"Inflation has continued to surprise on the downside in recent months,"
with core inflation at 1.1 per cent in November and total CPI inflation at
0.9 per cent.8 Alternative measures of core inflation have all fallen since
"the second half of 2012, with most currently at or slightly above 1 per cent"
"(Chart 15). Persistently weak inflation is not unique to Canada, but is also"
being observed in other advanced economies (Box 1).
There are several factors underlying the broad-based weakness in inflation in
Canada. The significant and persistent slack in the Canadian economy has
contributed to a marked increase since mid-2012 in the proportion of core
consumer goods and services for which prices are increasing by less than
2 per cent (Chart 16). Heightened competition in the retail sector is also con-
tributing to the weakness in inflation. This has been reflected in the unusual
"softness in the prices for core food items and non-durable goods, two sec-"
tors where anecdotal evidence suggests that competition is most intense
"(Chart 17). Moreover, there is a possibility that a given amount of excess"
supply is having a larger impact on inflation than had been anticipated.9 This
could be especially the case if excess supply has persisted for a long time.
Given the high degree of uncertainty around real-time estimates of the output
"gap, it is also possible that the level of economic slack is greater than cur-"
rently estimated.

"8	 Mortgage interest costs are currently dampening total CPI inflation relative to core inflation, on a"

"than when they were originated. At current mortgage interest rates, this effect would be expected to"
dissipate gradually over the projection horizon.
9	 Empirical work estimates a stronger relationship between a subset of core inflation and the output gap.

Both core and total CPI inflation are projected to remain around 1 per cent
"in the first half of 2014 and to increase very gradually toward the target, as"
excess capacity is absorbed and the impact of increased competition dissi-
pates (Chart 18).10 The depreciation of the Canadian dollar in the past year is
also expected to exert some upward pressure on inflation. The lower profile
for inflation relative to October mainly reflects the Bank’s assessment that
the effects of heightened competition on inflation will be more widespread
and persistent than previously assumed. While increased competition will
"have a permanent effect on the level of prices, its impact on the rate of"
inflation will be transitory. The assumption in the Bank’s base-case projec-
tion is that it will subtract around 0.3 percentage points from core inflation
"in 2014, with the effects largely dissipating by around the middle of 2015."
10	 The indirect effects associated with the restoration of the provincial sales tax in British Columbia are
still expected to have a minor impact on core inflation over the near term (see the April 2012 Monetary
Policy Report).

Bank of Canada  •  Monetary Policy Report  •  January 2014
To the extent that the effects of increased retail competition have a transi-
"tory impact on inflation, they should not necessarily elicit a monetary policy"
response unless they induce a change in inflation expectations.
Indicators of inflation expectations are consistent with the Bank’s projec-
tion. The January Consensus Economics forecast for total CPI inflation
was 1.5 per cent for 2014 and 1.9 per cent for 2015. According to the latest
"Business Outlook Survey, inflation expectations remain steady, with almost"
all firms expecting CPI inflation to be within the Bank’s 1 to 3 per cent infla-
"tion-control range over the next two years, and with the majority expecting"
inflation to remain in the bottom half of that range. Market-based measures
of longer-term inflation expectations continue to be consistent with the
2 per cent inflation-control target.11
"Based on the past dispersion of private sector forecasts, a reasonable range"
around the base-case projection for total inflation in 2014 is ± 0.3 percentage
points.12 This range is intended to measure ex ante forecast uncertainty. Fan
"charts, which are derived using statistical analysis of ex post errors from the"
"Bank’s projection models, provide a complementary perspective. Chart 19"
and Chart 20 show the 50 per cent and 90 per cent confidence bands for
year-over-year core inflation and total CPI inflation from the first quarter
of 2014 to the end of 2015. The degree of uncertainty around the inflation
"forecast, and the range of weaker-than-projected outcomes in particular, are"
important considerations for policy in light of the low level of inflation and the
recent series of downside surprises.
11	 Inflation has been below target in most major advanced economies. While long-term inflation
"expectations seem to be well anchored, short-term inflation expectations have drifted ­"
downward in
these economies.
12	 See Box 1 in the October 2013 Monetary Policy Report for details on how this range was calculated.

external environment and the domestic economy. The Bank judges that the
risks to the projected inflation path are roughly balanced.
The most important risks to inflation are:
(i)
Stronger U.S. investment
The major upside risk to inflation in Canada is the possibility of
stronger-than-expected growth in U.S. private demand. Business
"investment in the United States has been subdued, in part reflecting"
the cautiousness of firms in a highly uncertain environment. As the
"economy strengthens and uncertainty dissipates, business sentiment"
"should improve, and firms may not only increase investment, but"
they may also make up for the previous shortfall. This would boost
"economic activity and confidence more generally, leading to positive"
spillover effects throughout the U.S. economy. It would also likely
be accompanied by higher U.S. market interest rates and a stronger
U.S. dollar. Although this would put upward pressure on market
"interest rates in Canada, these effects would be more than offset"
by the increase in U.S. real GDP. Stronger U.S. demand would be
transmitted to the Canadian economy through the trade channel and
"firmer commodity prices, as well as through reduced uncertainty and"
positive confidence effects.
(ii)
Underperformance in Canadian exports
"Over the past two years, a significant wedge has emerged between"
the level of Canadian exports and that of foreign demand. While
prospects for the global economy have improved and the Canadian
"dollar has depreciated in the past year, the base-case projection is"
conservative in assuming that only a small portion of this wedge will
"dissipate over the next two years. However, with the performance"
"of exports still disappointing, there is a risk that the growth rate of"
exports will continue to fall below that of foreign activity in coming

years. This could reflect more intense competitiveness pressures
"or an inability to respond rapidly to increases in demand, given the"
reduced production capacity in some export sectors. A weaker
recovery of exports would translate into slower growth in business
"investment. Together, weaker growth in both exports and business"
investment would pose a downside risk to inflation.
(iii)
Imbalances in the household sector
The evolution of the housing sector continues to support the
Bank’s soft-landing scenario. Housing starts are largely in line with
"demographic demand, and resale activity is close to its historical"
"average. Households remain vulnerable to adverse economic shocks,"
"however, given that household leverage remains elevated and the"
ratio of house prices to income is close to its all-time high. The risk
"of a disorderly unwinding of household sector imbalances, should it"
"materialize, could have sizable spillover effects on other parts of the"
economy and on inflation.
