Bank of Canada maintains overnight rate
target at 1 ½ per cent
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Media Relations
"Ottawa, Ontario"
"September 5, 2018"
The Bank of Canada today maintained its target for the overnight rate at 1 ½ per
cent. The Bank Rate is correspondingly 1 ¾ per cent and the deposit rate is 1 ¼
per cent.
"CPI inflation moved up to 3 per cent in July. This was higher than expected, in"
large part because of a jump in the airfare component of the consumer price
index. The Bank expects CPI inflation to move back towards 2 per cent in early
"2019, as the effects of past increases in gasoline prices dissipate. The Bank’s core"
"measures of inflation remain firmly around 2 per cent, consistent with an"
economy that has been operating near capacity for some time. Wage growth
remains moderate.
Recent data on the global economy have been consistent with the Bank’s July
"Monetary Policy Report (MPR) projections. The US economy is particularly robust,"
with strong consumer spending and business investment. Elevated trade tensions
remain a key risk to the global outlook and are pulling some commodity prices
"lower. Meanwhile, financial stresses have intensified in certain emerging market"
"economies, but with limited spillovers to other countries."
The Canadian economy is evolving closely in line with the Bank’s July projection for
growth to average near potential. Following growth of 1.4 per cent in the first
"quarter, GDP rebounded by 2.9 per cent in the second quarter, as the Bank had"
"forecast. GDP growth is expected to slow temporarily in the third quarter, mainly"
because of further fluctuations in energy production and exports.
"While uncertainty about trade policies continues to weigh on businesses, the"
rotation of demand towards business investment and exports is proceeding.
"Despite choppiness in the data, both business investment and exports have been"
"growing solidly for several quarters. Meanwhile, activity in the housing market is"
beginning to stabilize as households adjust to higher interest rates and changes in
housing policies. Continuing gains in employment and labour income are helping
to support consumption. As past interest rate increases work their way through
"the economy, credit growth has moderated and the household debt-to-income"
ratio is beginning to edge down.

Recent data reinforce Governing Council’s assessment that higher interest rates
will be warranted to achieve the inflation target. We will continue to take a gradual
"approach, guided by incoming data. In particular, the Bank continues to gauge the"
economy’s reaction to higher interest rates. The Bank is also monitoring closely
"the course of NAFTA negotiations and other trade policy developments, and their"
impact on the inflation outlook.
Information note
"The next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is October 24,"
"2018. The next full update of the Bank’s outlook for the economy and inflation,"
"including risks to the projection, will be published in the MPR at the same time."
