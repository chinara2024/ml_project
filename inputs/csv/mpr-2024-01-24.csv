Canada’s infl
ation-control strategy
Infl
ation targeting and the economy
""

The objective of Canada’s monetary policy is to promote the
economic and fi
nancial well-being of Canadians. Canada’s
experience with infl
ation targeting since 1991 has shown that the
best way that monetary policy can achieve this goal is by maintaining
a low and stable infl
ation environment. Doing so fosters confi
dence
"in the value of money and contributes to sustained economic growth,"
a strong and inclusive labour market and improved living standards.
""

"In 2021, the Government of Canada and the Bank of Canada"
renewed the fl
exible infl
ation-targeting strategy of the monetary policy
framework for a further fi
"ve-year period, ending December 31, 2026.1"
""

The infl
ation target was renewed at the 2% midpoint of the 1%–3%
"control range, with infl"
ation measured as the 12-month rate of
change in the consumer price index (CPI).
""

The Government and the Bank agreed that the best contribution
monetary policy can make to the economic and fi
nancial
well-being of Canadians is to continue to focus on price stability.
The Government and the Bank also agreed that monetary policy
"should continue to support maximum sustainable employment,"
recognizing that maximum sustainable employment is not directly
measurable and is determined largely by non-monetary factors
that can change through time.
""

"Further, the Government and the Bank agreed that because well-"
anchored infl
ation expectations are critical to achieving both price
"stability and maximum sustainable employment, the primary objective"
"of monetary policy is to maintain low, stable infl"
ation over time.
Infl
ation targeting is symmetric and ﬂ
exible
""

Canada’s infl
"ation-targeting approach is symmetric, which means"
the Bank is equally concerned about infl
ation rising above or falling
below the 2% target.
""

Canada’s infl
ation-targeting approach is also ﬂ
"exible. Typically,"
the Bank seeks to return infl
ation to target over a horizon of six to
"eight quarters. However, the most appropriate horizon for returning"
infl
ation to target will vary depending on the nature and persistence
of the shocks buffeting the economy.
""

The 2021 agreement with the Government specifi
es that the 2%
infl
ation target remains the cornerstone of the framework.
""

The agreement further notes that the Bank will continue to use the
fl
exibility of the 1%–3% control range to actively seek the maximum
"sustainable level of employment, when conditions warrant. The Bank"
will also continue to leverage the fl
exibility inherent in the framework
to help address the challenges of structurally low interest rates by
using a broad set of policy tools. The Bank will use this fl
exibility only
to an extent that is consistent with keeping medium-term infl
ation
expectations well anchored at 2%.
Monetary policy tools
""

Because monetary policy actions take time to work their way through
the economy and have their full effect on infl
"ation, monetary policy"
must be forward-looking.
""

The Bank normally carries out monetary policy through changes
in the target for the overnight rate of interest (the policy rate). The
Bank also has a range of monetary policy tools it can use when the
policy rate is at very low levels. These tools consist of guidance on
"the future evolution of the policy rate, large-scale asset purchases"
"(quantitative easing and credit easing), funding for credit measures,"
and negative policy rates. The potential use and sequencing of these
tools would depend on the economic and fi
nancial market context.
""

All of the Bank’s monetary policy tools affect total demand for
Canadian goods and services through their infl
uence on market
"interest rates, domestic asset prices and the exchange rate. The"
balance between this demand and the economy’s production
"capacity is, over time, the main factor that determines infl"
ation
pressures in the economy.
Communications
""

"Consistent with its commitment to clear, transparent communications,"
the Bank regularly reports its perspectives on the economy and
infl
ation. Policy decisions are typically announced on eight pre-set
days during the year with a press release followed by a press
"conference, and full updates to the Bank’s outlook are published four"
times each year in the Monetary Policy Report.
""

The Bank is committed to explaining when it is using the fl
exibility of
the infl
ation-targeting strategy.
""

Given the uncertainty about the maximum sustainable level of
"employment, the Bank will consider a broad range of labour market"
indicators. The Bank will also systematically report to Canadians on
how labour market outcomes have factored into its policy decisions.
Monitoring infl
ation
""

"In the short run, the prices of certain CPI components can be"
particularly volatile and can cause sizable fl
uctuations in CPI infl
ation.
""

"In setting monetary policy, the Bank seeks to look through such"
transitory movements in CPI infl
ation and focuses on “core” infl
ation
measures that better refl
ect the underlying trend of infl
ation. In this
"sense, these measures act as an operational guide to help the Bank"
achieve the CPI infl
ation target. They are not a replacement for CPI
infl
ation.
""

The Bank’s two preferred measures of core infl
"ation are CPI-trim,"
which excludes CPI components whose rates of change in a given
"month are the most extreme, and CPI-median, which corresponds"
to the price change located at the 50th percentile (in terms of basket
weight) of the distribution of price changes.

Overview
Overview
The global economy is slowing but has been more robust than anticipated
"in the October Report, in large part due to the surprising strength of the US"
economy. Growth is expected to moderate further in 2024. Inflation is coming
down in most major economies and is expected to continue to decline
gradually toward central banks’ targets.
"In Canada, consumer price index (CPI) inflation is still too high but is easing"
gradually. Recent data reinforce that monetary policy is working to moderate
spending and relieve price pressures across a wider range of goods and
"services. However, shelter price inflation is high and is expected to put"
upward pressure on inflation for some time.
Economic growth stalled in Canada in the middle of 2023. Given this
"weakness, supply has caught up with demand, and the economy now looks"
"to be in modest excess supply. Labour market conditions have also eased,"
with more indicators signalling an improved balance between labour supply
"and demand. However, wage growth is still around 4% to 5%."
"In 2024, economic activity is forecast to remain weak in the first quarter"
"and then to pick up gradually, with annual growth in gross domestic product"
(GDP) just under 1%. Past interest rate increases will continue to constrain
"household spending and business investment, while weak foreign demand"
will slow export growth. Spending by governments contributes materially to
growth through 2024. GDP growth is projected to rise to about 2½% in 2025.
Inflation is projected to stay around 3% through the first half of 2024. As
"excess supply in the economy weighs on prices, inflation is forecast to ease"
to 2½% in the second half of 2024 and to return to target in 2025.
"While the economy is evolving largely as projected in the October Report,"
"considerable uncertainty remains. Overall, the risks to the outlook for inflation"
appear balanced. Given that inflation is still above 3% and underlying inflation
"is proving persistent, the Bank of Canada remains concerned that upside"
risks could materialize and cause inflation to remain above the target for
longer than expected.

Global economy
Global economy
Inflation is easing across most economies and across a widening range of
"goods and services. With slowing growth, inflation rates in most advanced"
economies are expected to come down slowly and reach central bank targets
in 2025. The pace of disinflation is gradual because prices for services—
including shelter—are still increasing at an elevated rate in many economies.
Global growth slowed in 2023 but has been stronger than anticipated at this
"time last year, partly because of unexpected strength in the US economy."
"US consumption has been strong, supported by resilient employment growth"
and households continuing to spend savings they accumulated during the
"COVID-19 pandemic. Since the October Report, the outlook for the US"
economy has been revised up again (Box 1).
"Nevertheless, global growth is expected to slow further in 2024 (Table 1).1 In"
"the United States, this is due to a slowdown in consumption as households"
continue to adjust to past increases in interest rates and have less
pandemic-era savings. Ongoing structural and policy challenges should
restrain activity in China. Modest economic growth is expected in the euro
area. Global growth strengthens in 2025 as the impacts of past monetary
tightening fade and financial conditions ease.

Lower inflation
Inflation is easing across a growing range of goods and services around
the world (Chart 1 and Chart 2). Inflation in prices for core goods continues
to decline in the United States and the euro area. This is due to past
improvements in supply chains and the shift in spending away from goods
toward services. Past increases in policy rates are also playing an important
"role. The decrease in inflation has been most apparent in durable goods, the"
demand for which tends to be more sensitive to changes in interest rates.
Further declines in inflation in core goods prices are expected in the United
States and the euro area as demand weakens. Goods price inflation in
the euro area also slows due to fading cost pressures from past energy
disruptions and less pressure on import prices—partly reflecting falling
"producer prices in China. However, further disruptions to trade through the"
Red Sea could reverse some of the downward pressure on inflation that has
come from improvements in supply chains.
"Inflation in prices for core services, including shelter, remains elevated but"
has also been falling gradually. This decline is expected to continue in 2024.
"In the United States, inflation in prices for core services excluding shelter"
is expected to moderate as monetary policy constrains demand and labour
market conditions ease. Wage growth is expected to slow while productivity
growth remains solid. Shelter price inflation is projected to ease from an
elevated rate due to the delayed effect from slower growth in rental prices for
new tenants.
Box 1
Changes to the economic projection since the October Report
Global outlook
The outlook for global growth is somewhat stronger over
the projection compared with the October Report.
""
 Growth in the United States has been revised up for
2023 and 2024. Projected annual growth for 2024 is
now approximately 1 percentage point higher. The
upward revision refl
ects a combination of eased
fi
nancial conditions and higher-than-expected
government expenditures.
""
" Overall, the level of global gross domestic product"
(GDP) is expected to be almost ½% higher at the
end of the projection.
Canadian outlook
The Canadian economy has evolved largely as
projected in the October Report.
""
 Growth in GDP in the third quarter of 2023 was
"somewhat below expectations.1 Notably, there was"
weakness in the consumption of goods and services
that are sensitive to interest rates.
""
 The outlook for GDP growth is broadly unchanged
in 2024 and 2025. Table 2 and Table 3 show the
revisions to the forecast.
The outlook for consumer price index infl
ation has been
"revised down by 0.2 percentage points, on average,"
through the end of 2024 and is unchanged in 2025. The
revision mainly refl
ects the impacts of lower gasoline
prices that result from a lower assumption about oil
prices over the projection.
1 Historical revisions to previous years have left the level of Canadian
GDP roughly 0.8% higher by the end of the second quarter of 2023. The
assessment of the output gap is largely unchanged for the third quarter of
2023 due to a small upward revision to potential output and weaker-than-
expected GDP growth.

"In the euro area, inflation in services prices is receding, as pent-up demand"
from the pandemic has faded and monetary policy weighs on demand.
"Nevertheless, some cost pressures linger as wage growth remains elevated"
despite slow productivity growth.
The recent fall in energy prices is also projected to generate some ongoing
"downward pressure on headline inflation in the coming months. Overall,"
inflation returns sustainably to target in the United States and the euro area
in 2025.

Easier financial conditions
The sharp tightening in financial conditions experienced before the October
"Report has dissipated, led by declines in yields on long-term government"
"bonds. Two main factors have contributed to these declines. First, the term"
"premium is estimated to have fallen, as markets perceive fewer risks to the"
"outlook for growth and inflation. Second, real yields have decreased as"
markets have also revised down their expectations for policy rates. As a
"result of these factors, nominal yields on 10-year US government bonds have"
fallen by around 75 basis points (bps) since the October Report (Chart 3).
This has contributed to declines in corporate borrowing rates and the interest
rates on household mortgages.
Credit conditions have also shown signs of easing. Issuance of US corporate
"bonds has been robust, and credit spreads have narrowed. Moreover, US"
equity prices have rebounded strongly.
The Canadian dollar has remained close to the level observed at the time of
the October Report (Chart 4).

Slowing global economy
Economic growth in the United States is expected to slow in 2024. Growth in
consumer spending moderates in the near term as spending of accumulated
savings no longer offsets the effects of past increases in borrowing costs.
"Moreover, banks have become less willing to lend money to consumers,"
and labour income growth is projected to slow. Softening consumer demand
and still-elevated corporate borrowing rates are also projected to weaken
"US business investment. Moreover, government spending is not expected to"
support growth in 2024 to the extent that it did in 2023.
Private domestic demand leads a modest pickup in quarterly growth in the
United States starting in late 2024 as the impacts of past monetary tightening
fade and financial conditions ease.
China’s economy is expected to grow between 4% and 5% over the
projection horizon. Ongoing issues in the property sector as well as policy
uncertainty and weak consumer confidence continue to restrain activity.
Growth in the euro area remains modest. Past interest rate increases are
"acting as a drag on demand. In addition, foreign demand is subdued, and"
factors such as the strength of the euro and comparatively high energy costs
have eroded competitiveness and are hampering growth. Growth is projected
to pick up gradually over 2024 and 2025 as the effects of energy shortages
fade and monetary policy becomes less restrictive.

Lower oil prices
"The price of Brent oil is close to US$80, considerably lower than the"
assumption of US$90 in the October Report (Chart 5 and Box 2). The
decline reflects a combination of better-than-expected conditions for supply
and weaker-than-anticipated demand for oil.
"The risk premium in oil prices has declined, reflecting the market’s"
assessment that the war in Israel and Gaza is less likely to have a negative
"impact on global oil supply. Moreover, oil production in countries that are"
not members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries
"has expanded faster than anticipated in recent months, led by the United"
"States, Brazil and Guyana. Global demand for oil has moderated more than"
expected due to the slowdown in global manufacturing activity and an easing
in demand growth for transportation fuels.
The Bank of Canada’s Commodity Price Index excluding energy has been
"flat since the October Report, with strengthening lumber prices offset by"
weakness in other commodities.

Box 2
Key inputs to the projection
The Bank of Canada’s projection is conditional on
several key inputs and assumptions about their future
path. The Bank regularly reviews these assumptions
and adjusts the economic projection accordingly. The
key inputs to the Bank’s projection are as follows:
""
" Over the projection horizon, the per-barrel prices"
for oil in US dollars are assumed to be $80 for
"Brent, $75 for West Texas Intermediate and $60 for"
Western Canadian Select. These prices are all $10
lower than in the October Report.
""
" By convention, the Bank does not forecast the"
exchange rate in the Monetary Policy Report. The
Canadian dollar is assumed to remain at 74 cents
"US over the projection horizon, close to its recent"
average and unchanged from the assumption in the
October Report.
""
 Potential output in Canada is expected to increase
by about 2% on average over 2023 to 2025.1
""
 The latest estimate for population growth in 2023
is close to 3%. Population growth is projected to
average just below 2% in 2024 and 2025.2
"1 As per the usual practice, potential output and the nominal neutral interest"
rate will be reassessed in April 2024.
2 These population estimates are for people aged 15 years and older. The
2023 population growth estimate is based on a combination of data from
Statistics Canada’s Labour Force Survey and quarterly population estimates.
The projection over 2024 and 2025 is based on a combination of the high-
growth (HG) and medium-growth (M1) population scenarios from Statistics
Canada.
""
 Growth in real gross domestic product is estimated
to be close to zero in the fourth quarter of 2023. As
"a result, the Bank estimates that the output gap is"
"between -0.25% and -1.25% in the fourth quarter,"
which is 0.5 percentage points lower than the
estimate for the third quarter of 2023.
""
 The projection incorporates information from all
provincial and federal budgets available at the time
of writing.
""
 The nominal neutral interest rate in Canada is
estimated to be in the range of 2% to 3%. The
economic projection assumes that the neutral rate
is at the midpoint of this range. The nominal neutral
interest rate is defi
ned as the real neutral rate plus
2% for infl
ation. The real neutral rate is the rate
consistent with both output remaining sustainably
at its potential and infl
ation remaining at target
on an ongoing basis. It is a medium- to long-term
equilibrium concept.

"CPI inflation continued to ease, reaching 3.3% in the fourth quarter of 2023."
"Since the October Report, data have provided further evidence that monetary"
policy is working as expected to slow growth and eliminate excess demand
"pressures on inflation. However, inflation remains too high, with persistent"
strength in shelter and food price inflation.
Economic growth is anticipated to remain close to zero through the first
quarter of 2024. It is then expected to pick up gradually as the effects of
past interest rate increases on growth begin to fade and the recent easing in
financial conditions supports demand. Inflation is expected to remain close to
3% over the first half of 2024 before easing gradually and returning to the 2%
target in 2025.
"Despite significant progress since the summer of 2022, considerable"
uncertainty remains about the pace of future decreases in inflation. While
"the slowdown in the economy is anticipated to reduce inflationary pressures,"
other forces could keep inflation above the target for longer than expected.
Stalled economic activity
Economic growth is estimated to have stalled since the middle of 2023
"(Table 2, Table 3 and Chart 6). Past interest rate increases continue to"
"weigh on household spending and business investment, and slowing foreign"
"demand has restrained exports. Temporary factors, such as the Quebec"
"public sector strikes, also impact growth in the near term. In the first quarter"
"of 2024, growth is expected to remain close to zero."
Consumption per capita has declined and will likely continue to contract in
the near term. It has been particularly weak for goods and services that are
"sensitive to interest rates, such as furniture, restaurants and accommodations"
(Chart 7). Some of this weakness has been offset by the recovery in travel
spending and by strength in motor vehicle sales due to increased product
"availability. Housing resale activity has also been weak, and house prices"
"fell in the fourth quarter. However, new construction activity has picked up,"
responding to increased demand from strong population growth.

Easing financial conditions
Financial conditions have eased for Canadian households and businesses
"since the October Report, even though policy interest rates remain elevated."
Long-term government bond yields have fallen. Bank funding costs have also
"gone down, and financial institutions have subsequently lowered their interest"
"rates for mortgages. For example, five-year fixed mortgage rates have fallen"
by about 65 basis points since mid-October 2023 (Chart 8). Equity prices
"have risen, and corporate credit spreads have also narrowed."
"However, elevated borrowing costs have weighed on household and business"
credit growth over the past year (Chart 9). The Senior Loan Officer Survey
for the third quarter of 2023 also reported an overall tightening in business
lending conditions. Measures of household financial stress have continued to
edge up in recent months. Delinquency rates are rising. Those for mortgages
"remain low compared with pre-pandemic levels, while those for other debt"
products are the same or have increased.

Economy in modest excess supply
"Demand growth has stalled since the middle of 2023 amid rising supply, and"
the economy is judged to have moved into modest excess supply.
The output gap is estimated to have fallen to between -0.25% and -1.25%
in the fourth quarter of 2023. This is broadly in line with evidence from the
Bank’s Business Outlook Survey that businesses are in a better position
than they were a year ago to deal with an unexpected increase in demand

Labour market conditions have eased further. The job vacancy rate has
"declined to near pre-pandemic levels, and job creation has been slower than"
the pace implied by population growth (Chart 11). The unemployment rate
has risen modestly to 5.8% from 5.5% last summer. Respondents to the
Bank’s business surveys reported that labour shortages have declined and
"are close to their historical averages. In contrast, wage growth is still elevated"
"at around 4% to 5%. Overall, the evidence suggests that labour supply and"
demand are better balanced.
Inflationary pressures easing but still elevated
CPI inflation declined from 8.1% in June 2022 to 3.4% in December 2023.
The initial decreases were largely due to falling energy prices and
improvements in global supply chains. Evidence continues to mount that
the slowing economy is leading to lower price pressures across a broad
range of goods and services.
"Despite this progress, CPI inflation is still too high. Shelter service price"
inflation remains elevated at close to 7% due to rising mortgage interest costs
and strong growth in rent (Box 3).2 Food price inflation has declined from its
peak but is still around 5%. Inflation in services excluding shelter has fallen
"significantly. However, the decline is far less pronounced when each month’s"
most volatile prices are removed. This suggests that underlying pressures on
services prices could persist.
2	 Shelter services excludes utilities other than water. This differs slightly from Statistics Canada’s definition
"of shelter, which includes those utilities."

Box 3
CPI infl
ation and the evolution of shelter costs
"In Canada, consumer price index (CPI) infl"
ation began
to climb in the spring of 2021 and reached 5.7% by
February 2022. The pickup included a strong increase
in shelter services price infl
ation.1 This was driven by
a 14% rise in components related to house prices.
Increases in house prices refl
ected the strong demand
"for housing, partly resulting from low mortgage rates.2"
In response to rising infl
"ation, the Bank of Canada began"
to rapidly increase the policy interest rate in March 2022.
"Over time, these increases have helped reduce infl"
ation
across a wide range of goods and services.
An important exception is infl
ation in shelter services
"prices, which remains elevated around 7%. While this is"
"similar to its rate in early 2022, important changes have"
occurred within its key components:
""
 Infl
ation in components related to house prices has
since turned slightly negative because rising interest
rates have reduced demand for owned housing.
""
 Mortgage interest costs and rental price infl
ation
have risen sharply and are currently around 29%
"and 8%, respectively. These components are now"
the main drivers of infl
ation in prices for shelter
services.3
""
" For all other components, infl"
ation rose to 5% in
December 2023 from 3% in February 2022.
The decline in overall shelter price infl
ation has been
smaller than it was during other monetary policy
tightening cycles. Several factors can explain this
outcome:
""
 Mortgage interest costs are boosting infl
ation to a
greater extent than in previous episodes of monetary
policy tightening. This refl
ects the combined effect of a
long period of historically low interest rates and a very
rapid increase in policy rates through 2022 and 2023.
1 Shelter services excludes utilities other than water. This differs slightly from
Statistics Canada’s defi
"nition of shelter, which includes those utilities."
2 Components related to house prices include homeowners’ replacement costs
and other owned-accommodation expenses.
3 Increases in interest rates support rental price infl
ation by reducing the
"affordability of housing, which keeps households in the rental market for"
longer. Interest rate increases also lead to higher debt costs for property
"owners, which can be passed on to tenants."
""
 Several long-standing structural constraints have
"held back growth in housing supply. For example,"
"home builders point to zoning restrictions, lengthy"
permitting processes and a shortage of construction
workers.
""
 A larger increase in newcomers than in the past is
adding pressure to the structural supply constraint in
housing. This has helped to push the overall housing
"vacancy rate to record lows, which has underpinned"
house prices and led to higher rents (Chart 3-A).
Many of the forces supporting elevated shelter services
price infl
ation are expected to persist:
""
 Infl
ation in mortgage interest costs will remain
elevated as more households renew their mortgages
at rates that are higher than when they purchased
their home or when they last renewed their
mortgage.

Core inflation has remained elevated in the range of 3½% to 4% on a year-
over-year basis (Chart 12). The three-month rates are also in this range.
Alternative measures of core inflation have shown mixed results since the
"October Report. While CPIX has eased to about 2½%, CPI excluding food"
and energy has ticked up to around 3½%.
Box 3 (continued)
""
 Persistent structural supply challenges and strong
underlying demand from population growth will
likely continue to put pressure on house and rental
prices. While recent government actions should help
"moderate some of these constraints, the imbalances"

"As inflation eases toward the 2% target, inflation expectations are anticipated"
"to decline, businesses’ pricing behaviour to normalize further and wage"
"growth to moderate. While progress has been made, it is uneven across"
these inflation indicators.
Businesses are returning toward their pre-pandemic pricing behaviours.
The share of businesses expecting to increase their prices more often
"than normal has declined over the last four quarters, as has the share"
of businesses that anticipate posting larger-than-normal price increases
(Chart 14).
Near-term inflation expectations of businesses and households have also
"come down, but only very modestly (Chart 15). Results from the Business"
Outlook Survey for the fourth quarter of 2023 indicate that businesses’
"inflation expectations for the next two years have eased, but still average"
between 3% and 3½%.3 Consumers’ near-term inflation expectations have
"not declined significantly.4 In addition, the distribution of inflation expectations"
remains wider than it was before the pandemic. This suggests elevated
uncertainty about the path of inflation over the next few years. Long-term
expectations remain consistent with the 2% target.

Box 4
Real wages and productivity
Changes in wages and labour productivity can provide
insight into the evolution of infl
ationary pressures in the
Canadian economy. Although the individual experiences
of households have varied dramatically over the past
"few years, this box focuses on developments at an"
aggregate level.
Both infl
ation and nominal wages have experienced
large swings since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.
"In 2020, infl"
ation fell to under 1%. It then picked up
and averaged roughly 5% at an annual rate between
the fi
rst quarter of 2021 and the third quarter of 2023.
Nominal wages (compensation per hour worked in the
business sector) were also volatile but on average grew
just over 2% between the fi
rst quarter of 2021 and the
third quarter of 2023.1 The most recent data show that
real consumer wages—earnings per hour after adjusting
for CPI infl
ation—stand roughly 3% above the levels
recorded in the fourth quarter of 2019.2
"1 In 2020 and 2021, nominal wages were affected by compositional effects—"
particularly the unequal impacts of the pandemic on low-wage workers.
Nominal compensation per hour is methodologically consistent with the
"labour productivity data, which is not the case for other wage data."
2 If instead the defl
ator for household fi
nal consumption or the defl
ator for
"GDP were used to determine real wages, the result would be 5.5% or 0.5%,"
respectively.

BANK OF CANADA  •  Monetary Policy Report  •  January 2024
Slow demand growth and rising supply
"Economic growth is expected to be modest in 2024, largely unchanged from"
the October Report. The effects of past interest rate increases continue
"to restrain consumption and business investment. In addition, soft foreign"
demand will weigh on exports through the rest of the year. Spending by
governments contributes materially to growth through 2024. While strong
"population growth props up overall economic activity, GDP per capita is"
expected to continue declining over the near term.
"With demand continuing to grow more slowly than potential output, excess"
supply in the economy is projected to increase through the first half of 2024.
"Growth is expected to pick up around the middle of 2024, rising to about"
2½% in 2025 (Chart 17). Household spending strengthens as the dampening
"effects of monetary policy tightening on growth fade, financial conditions"
ease and confidence improves. Exports and business investment are
supported by the recovery in foreign demand.
Box 4 (continued)
"When evaluating their costs, businesses look at wages"
adjusted by output prices—in this case by using the
price level of gross domestic product (GDP) as a
proxy—rather than by the CPI.3 This is known as the
"real producer wage. As of the third quarter of 2023, the"
ratio between real producer wages and productivity
"had risen above its pre-pandemic level, pushing up unit"
labour costs (Chart 4-A).4 This development is broad-
"based across business sectors, and real producer"
wages are now growing faster than productivity in 13 of
16 industries (Chart 4-B).
"Wages, productivity and the outlook for"
infl
ation
Labour market conditions appear to be easing. Job
"vacancies are nearing their pre-pandemic levels, and"
evidence from Bank surveys suggests that businesses
expect wage growth to ease over 2024.
Even if real wages rise faster than productivity for a
"short period, infl"
"ation may not increase. For instance,"
higher wage costs could be absorbed by businesses’
profi
"t margins or be offset by declining non-labour costs,"
such as energy or imported inputs. If the period of weak
productivity growth relative to real wages continues
"for an extended period, businesses may pass on the"
"additional costs, adding to infl"
ationary pressures.
3 The CPI is a measure of households’ cost of living. It includes many
imported fi
nal consumer goods that do not factor into calculating businesses’
profi
tability.
4 The choice of defl
ator does not change the fi
nding presented here. Using
"either the price level of GDP, the CPI or the price level of fi"
nal consumption
results in a ratio that is at or above its pre-pandemic level.

Weak household spending growth
Growth in consumption is expected to remain weak until the end of 2024.
"While consumption is supported by strong population growth, on a per capita"
basis it is projected to continue declining through 2024. This is partly due to
"slow growth in labour income as the labour market eases further. In addition,"
consumer spending is held back by high debt-servicing costs and weak
consumer confidence. Responses to the Canadian Survey of Consumer
Expectations for the fourth quarter of 2023 indicate that households are
cutting back on their spending and delaying purchases. Spending on most
"major purchases remains muted, especially for durable goods, which are"
more likely to be purchased on credit.
"In 2025, consumer spending is expected to recover as income growth"
improves and the drag from high debt-servicing costs gradually declines.
This decline is the net result of two opposing factors:
""
" For some time, households are expected to face higher interest rate"
payments when renewing their mortgages. The impact of the increases are
anticipated to become smaller as mortgage rates gradually ease.
""
" However, some variable-rate mortgage holders with fixed payments will"
need to reset their amortization schedules and their required payments to
catch up on their principal payments.
Residential investment is expected to pick up in early 2024. The boost to
"new construction comes from strong population growth, the recent easing in"
financial conditions and the waning effects of past increases in interest rates.
Resale activity is projected to increase from its current low levels. House
price growth is expected to be moderate over the projection horizon.

Soft business investment and export growth
Business investment is expected to remain weak through the first half of
"2024, held back by slow demand and still-elevated borrowing costs. It is"
anticipated to pick up in the second half of 2024 with the diminishing impact
of past interest rate increases as well as easing financial conditions and
improving demand.
Export growth is expected to remain modest over the near term due to soft
foreign demand for non-commodity exports. Plant shutdowns and retooling in
the auto sector will also likely continue to affect motor vehicle exports through
"most of 2024. Nevertheless, overall, exports are anticipated to increase in"
"the second half of the year—foreign demand will likely improve, and capacity"
for energy transportation will increase following the completion of the Trans
Mountain Expansion project.
Growth in imports will likely remain muted through the first half of 2024. It is
expected to pick up in the second half of 2024 and 2025 due to strengthening
domestic demand.
Inflation eases gradually
CPI inflation is expected to remain close to 3% over the first half of 2024.
Elevated shelter price inflation and food price inflation are contributing to
keep the level of inflation high (Chart 18).
"Some components of inflation are expected to ease. For example, inflation in"
prices for goods excluding food and energy is projected to slow as excess supply
deepens and inflation expectations decline. Food price inflation also slows
"because of lower global prices for agricultural products. More broadly, slowing"
"growth in input costs is expected to lead to lower inflation for many other goods,"
including non-durables. Most businesses interviewed in the Business Outlook
Survey expect input price growth to ease over the next 12 months.

BANK OF CANADA  •  Monetary Policy Report  •  January 2024
"In contrast, inflation in prices for services excluding shelter is anticipated to"
"pick up modestly over the near term, largely due to less downward pressure"
from telecommunications prices.
"As projected in the October Report, inflation is expected to decline to"
around 2½% in the second half of 2024 and then return to the target in
"2025 (Chart 19). Over the projection horizon, ongoing excess supply in the"
"economy continues to weigh on prices, and corporate pricing behaviour and"
inflation expectations gradually return to normal. Wage growth is expected to
"slow, falling closer in line with inflation and modest productivity growth."
Shelter price inflation remains elevated for some time. Growth in mortgage
interest costs remains high as households continue to face higher rates
at renewal and new mortgages are issued at rates above the average
"of the existing stock. Nevertheless, inflation in mortgage interest costs"
slows gradually as financial conditions ease and the impact of additional
households renewing and taking on new mortgages decreases. Rental
price inflation is supported by strong demand for housing and tight supply
"(Box 3). However, rental price inflation is also expected to moderate due to"
a slowdown in population growth and an expected increase in new housing
construction. House prices are expected to contribute only modestly to overall
shelter price inflation.

Risks to the inflation outlook
Risks to the inflation outlook
The Bank considers the outlook in the base-case scenario to be the most
likely outcome for inflation. The Bank sees both upside and downside risks to
this outlook. With inflation still above 3% and not expected to return to the 2%
"target for more than a year, the Bank remains particularly concerned about"
the upside risks.
Main upside risks
There are two broad types of upside risk: inflation could stall materially above
"2%, or new developments could lead to renewed inflationary pressures."
Progress toward the inflation target could stall
"First, inflation expectations have come down only very modestly over the"
past few quarters. If households and businesses continue to expect inflation
"to stay elevated, this could impede the pace at which price and wage growth"
moderate.
"Second, wages have been increasing at a fast pace relative to productivity"
"growth. On average, consumers’ real wages are higher than they were in"
2019. Productivity growth is effectively stalled and wages are still rising
"robustly. Because of this, the Bank remains concerned that cost pressures"
could add to inflation.
"Third, house prices could also rise more than anticipated. This would"
increase inflation by raising shelter costs. While the base case includes a
"modest increase in house prices, this forecast is subject to a high degree"
of uncertainty. This risk could materialize if easing financial conditions
lead to stronger-than-expected demand for housing while supply remains
constrained.
New developments could fuel renewed inflation
The conflict in Israel and Gaza and attacks on ships in the Red Sea are
affecting seaborne trade in the region and could push oil prices and shipping
"costs higher. So far, global disruptions from these developments have been"
"contained. But if the conflict were to spread further, oil prices could rise"
sharply and the prices for traded goods could also increase significantly.
Main downside risks
"As in the October Report, the main downside risk to inflation is a slowdown"
in the Canadian economy that is more pronounced than expected. Slowing
could occur through two main channels.
""
Risks to the inflation outlook	 24

""
BANK OF CANADA  •  Monetary Policy Report  •  January 2024
"First, monetary policy could have a greater impact than in the base case."
Many Canadians are facing upcoming mortgage renewals and record-high
levels of household debt. They could become more cautious and cut back
consumption spending more than projected. This could also lead to a larger-
than-expected slowdown in business investment and hiring.
"Second, global activity could be weaker than in the base case. This risk could"
materialize if central banks in the United States or the euro area need to
keep monetary policy tighter than expected to bring inflation back to target. In
"China, high debt levels of local governments and challenges in the property"
"sector could further limit growth. This could lead to weaker global demand,"
which may reduce prices for commodities and tradable goods.
Canadian economic growth and inflation would both be pulled down if these
risks were to materialize.
