Bank of Canada lowers overnight rate target
to ¾ percent
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Media Relations
"Ottawa, Ontario"
"March 13, 2020"
The Bank of Canada today lowered its target for the overnight rate by 50 basis
"points to ¾ percent, effective Monday, March 16, 2020. The Bank Rate is"
correspondingly 1 percent and the deposit rate is ½ percent. This unscheduled
rate decision is a proactive measure taken in light of the negative shocks to
Canada’s economy arising from the COVID-19 pandemic and the recent sharp
drop in oil prices.
It is clear that the spread of the coronavirus is having serious consequences for
"Canadian families, and for Canada’s economy. In addition, lower prices for oil,"
"even since our last scheduled rate decision on March 4, will weigh heavily on the"
"economy, particularly in energy intensive regions."
The Bank will provide a full update of its outlook for the Canadian and global
"economies on April 15. As the situation evolves, Governing Council stands ready"
to adjust monetary policy further if required to support economic growth and
keep inflation on target.
The Bank has also taken steps to ensure that the Canadian financial system has
sufficient liquidity. These additional measures have been announced in separate
notices on the Bank’s website. The Bank is closely monitoring economic and
"financial conditions, in coordination with other G7 central banks and fiscal"
authorities.
Information note
"The next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is April 15,"
"2020. The next full update of the Bank’s outlook for the economy and inflation,"
"including risks to the projection, will be published in the MPR at the same time."
