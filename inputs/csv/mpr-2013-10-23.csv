Canada’s Inﬂ
ation-Control Strategy1
Infl
ation targeting and the economy
• the Bank’s mandate is to conduct monetary policy to pro-
mote the economic and fi
nancial well-being of Canadians .
• Canada’s experience with infl
ation targeting since 1991
has shown that the best way to foster confi
dence in the
value of money and to contribute to sustained economic
"growth, employment gains and improved living standards"
is by keeping infl
"ation low, stable and predictable ."
"• In 2011, the Government and the Bank of Canada renewed"
Canada’s infl
ation-control target for a further fi
ve-year
"period, ending 31 december 2016 . the target, as measured"
"by the total consumer price index (CPI), remains at the"
2 per cent midpoint of the control range of 1 to 3 per cent .
The monetary policy instrument
• the Bank carries out monetary policy through changes
in the target overnight rate of interest .2 these changes
are transmitted to the economy through their infl
uence
"on market interest rates, domestic asset prices and the"
"exchange rate, which aff"
ect total demand for Canadian
goods and services . the balance between this demand
"and the economy’s production capacity is, over time, the"
primary determinant of infl
ation pressures in the economy .
• Monetary policy actions take time—usually from six to
eight quarters—to work their way through the economy
and have their full eff
ect on infl
"ation . For this reason,"
monetary policy must be forward looking .
"• Consistent with its commitment to clear, transparent"
"communications, the Bank regularly reports its perspec-"
tive on the forces at work on the economy and their
implications for infl
ation . the Monetary Policy Report is a
key element of this approach . Policy decisions are typi-
"cally announced on eight pre-set days during the year,"
"and full updates of the Bank’s outlook, including risks to"
"the projection, are published four times per year in the"
Monetary Policy Report .
Infl
ation targeting is symmetric and ﬂ
exible
• Canada’s infl
"ation-targeting approach is symmetric, which"
means that the Bank is equally concerned about infl
ation
rising above or falling below the 2 per cent target .
• Canada’s infl
ation-targeting framework is ﬂ
exible .
"typically, the Bank seeks to return infl"
ation to target over
"a horizon of six to eight quarters . However, the most"
appropriate horizon for returning infl
ation to target will
vary depending on the nature and persistence of the
shocks buff
eting the economy .
Monitoring infl
ation
"• In the short run, a good deal of movement in the CPI is"
caused by fl
uctuations in the prices of certain volatile
"components (e .g ., fruit and gasoline) and by changes in"
"indirect taxes . For this reason, the Bank also monitors a"
set of “core” infl
"ation measures, most importantly the"
"CPIX, which strips out eight of the most volatile CPI com-"
ponents and the eff
ect of indirect taxes on the remaining
components . these “core” measures allow the Bank to
“look through” temporary price movements and focus on
the underlying trend of infl
"ation . In this sense, core infl"
a-
tion is monitored as an operational guide to help the Bank
achieve the total CPI infl
ation target . It is not a replace-
ment for it .
1 See Joint Statement of the Government of Canada and the Bank of Canada on the Renewal of the Inﬂ
ation-Control Target (8 november 2011) and
Renewal of the Inﬂ
"ation-Control Target: Background Information—November 2011, which are both available on the Bank’s website ."
"2 When interest rates are at the zero lower bound, additional monetary easing to achieve the infl"
ation target can be provided through three unconven-
tional instruments: (i) a conditional statement on the future path of the policy rate; (ii) quantitative easing; and (iii) credit easing . these instruments
and the principles guiding their use are described in the Annex to the April 2009 Monetary Policy Report .

Global Economy
"The global economy is expected to expand modestly in 2013, although"
its near-term dynamic has changed and the composition of growth is
now slightly less ­
favourable for Canada. The U.S. economy is softer than
"expected but, as fiscal headwinds dissipate and household deleveraging"
"ends, growth should accelerate through 2014 and 2015. The nascent"
"recovery in Europe, while modest, has surprised on the upside. China’s"
"economy is showing renewed momentum, while growth in a number of other"
emerging-market economies has slowed as their financial conditions have
"tightened. Overall, the global economy is projected to grow by 2.8 per cent"
in 2013 and accelerate to 3.4 per cent in 2014 and 3.6 per cent in 2015 (Table 1).
Global financial conditions have been affected by the
anticipation of U.S. tapering
Global financial conditions tightened from May through September in response
to an anticipated slowing in the pace of asset purchases by the U.S. Federal
"Reserve. The market reaction was stronger than expected. More recently, finan-"
"cial conditions have eased somewhat, following the decision in September by"
the Federal Reserve to maintain the pace of its asset purchases.1
"In advanced economies, yields on government bonds have risen from the"
"lows reached in May, especially at longer maturities. A notable exception is"
"Japan, where bond yields have declined somewhat, owing to the Bank of"
Japan’s commitment to double the monetary base by the end of 2014 by pur-
chasing Japanese government bonds to achieve its 2 per cent inflation target.
1	 Political disagreements in the United States over the government budget added some further uncer-
"tainty to financial markets through the month of October, but the price effects were generally small and"
largely concentrated in very short-term U.S. government instruments.

Bank of Canada  •  Monetary Policy Report  •  October 2013
"Despite the recent tightening, global financial conditions remain highly sup-"
"portive—yields on most major government bonds are low by historical standards,"
and equity indexes are at multi-year high levels in several advanced economies
(Chart 1 and Chart 2). Yield spreads on most euro-area peripheral sovereign
"bonds have narrowed, reflecting signs of recovery in euro-area macroeconomic"
conditions and progress on reforms. Although spreads on U.S. corporate bonds
"have widened modestly since May, issuance has remained solid."
The tightening of financial conditions in EMEs has been more pronounced than
in advanced economies. The anticipation of U.S. tapering and a reassessment
"of the growth prospects for some EMEs have led to capital outflows, a marked"
"rise in bond yields and a decline in equity prices (Chart 3). However, there"
has been significant market differentiation among EMEs: those with weaker
"economic fundamentals, such as large fiscal and current account deficits, high"
"inflation and declining growth prospects, have been the most affected."

Bank of Canada  •  Monetary Policy Report  •  October 2013
Recent softness in the U.S. economy is projected to give way to
a solid recovery
U.S. real GDP grew by slightly less than 2 per cent during the first half of
2013. Growth is projected to have remained modest in the second half of the
year and below expectations in July.
This near-term softness has been broad-based. Consumer spending has
been dampened by the increase in payroll taxes in January 2013 and a mod-
"eration in employment growth (Chart 4). Housing activity has also slowed,"
largely in response to the 95-basis-point rise in mortgage interest rates. In
"contrast, business investment has increased, but by less than expected,"
despite strong corporate balance sheets. Government spending continues
to contract as the sequestration cuts are implemented.
The failure to reach a timely agreement to fund government operations
resulted in a partial government shutdown in the first half of October. The
"shutdown will dampen economic growth in the fourth quarter, through the"
"direct effect of furloughed government workers, and, more broadly, through"
"negative effects on confidence. In addition, the debt-ceiling debate has"
exacerbated the adverse impact on confidence and economic activity.
The projection for U.S. real GDP growth in the second half of 2013 is signifi-
"cantly lower than in the July Report, mainly reflecting softer-than-expected"
domestic demand. The drag from previous tax increases and spending cuts
"is expected to amount to 1.8 percentage points in 2013, and then to decline"
to 0.8 percentage points in 2014 and zero in 2015. Monetary policy remains
"highly stimulative, with members of the Federal Open Market Committee"
expecting the first increase in the federal funds rate to occur only in 2015.
The expansion of U.S. private sector demand in 2014 and 2015 should be
"broad-based. Consumption is projected to increase at a more solid pace,"
supported by substantially healthier household balance sheets (Chart 5)
and improving labour market conditions. Residential investment should also
"increase vigorously, given the strong underlying fundamentals: the still-low"
"level of mortgage interest rates, an expected rebound in household formation,"

"significant pent-up demand, and the decline in both actual and shadow inven-"
tories of homes. Business investment will benefit from the improvement in
"demand, as well as from the solid financial positions of firms."
Exports are also projected to be an important driver of U.S. economic
"growth through 2015, supported by strengthening foreign demand and"
improved competitiveness brought about by sustained gains in productivity
"and lower energy costs. While overseas oil imports should continue to fall,"
"reflecting the expansion in domestic supply, non-oil imports are expected to"
"increase steadily, driven by stronger domestic demand."

Bank of Canada  •  Monetary Policy Report  •  October 2013
"Overall, U.S. economic activity is expected to strengthen as fiscal headwinds"
dissipate and household deleveraging ends. The Bank projects that the
"U.S. economy will grow by 1.5 per cent in 2013, 2.5 per cent in 2014 and"
"3.3 per cent in 2015. Based on past dispersion of private sector forecasts,"
U.S. economic growth in 2014 would be expected to fall within ± 0.5 per-
"centage points of the Bank’s projection, with a somewhat wider range in 2015"
(Box 1).
"U.S. inflation has been on a declining trend since early 2012, owing to"
substantial slack in the economy and various temporary factors. As excess
"supply is gradually reduced over the projection period, inflation is expected"
to move back toward the Federal Reserve’s 2 per cent inflation target.
Box 1
Determining Uncertainty Around the Bank’s Projection for Key Variables
"For policy purposes, it is important to acknowledge that"
economic projections are subject to considerable uncer-
tainty and are revised over time as new economic data
"become available . to convey a sense of uncertainty, this"
Monetary Policy Report provides “rule of thumb” ranges
around the base-case projection for the growth of U .S . and
Canadian GdP and Canadian total CPI infl
"ation, as well as"
for the current level of the output gap and the growth rate of
potential output in Canada .
the approaches used to construct the range around each
projection diff
"er . For example, the intervals for projected"
GdP growth and infl
ation are informed by the average
cross-
sectional dispersion of private sector forecasters
surveyed by Consensus Economics .1 A reasonable rule of
"thumb interval for both Canadian and U .S . growth in 2014,"
"consistent with this approach, is ±0 .5 percentage points .2"
Using the same method for total CPI infl
ation suggests a
range of around ±0 .3 percentage points . Since this rule of
1
"the sample used to calculate the average dispersion is 2000–13, and in each case,"
the highest and lowest forecasts were dropped from the sample .
2 the precise average dispersion in GdP forecasts (for the following year) is
±0 .4 percentage points for Canada and ±0 .7 percentage points for the United
States (the United States is higher largely because of a greater number of
""
forecasters in the sample) . Consensus Economics only provides the average
"forecast at a 2-year horizon, so dispersion cannot be calculated ."
"thumb range is an ex ante measure of uncertainty, it is dif-"
"ferent from the ranges presented in Chart 26 and Chart 27,"
which are based on statistical analysis of realized (ex post)
forecast errors .
"Since potential GdP is not widely forecast, it is impossible to"
"compute forecast dispersion . In this case, it is more informa-"
tive to show a range based on sensitivity analyses around the
various assumptions on which our projection is based . this
suggests a range for Canadian potential output growth of
approximately ±0 .3 percentage points (see Appendix A) .
"Finally, the ±0 .5-percentage-point range for the 2013Q3"
output gap is based roughly on the range of estimates from
"the Bank’s various output-gap indicators . For example, the"
conventional estimate of excess supply for the same quarter
"is 1 .3 per cent, whereas a more structural cohort-based"
"model suggests excess supply of 1 .8 per cent . As a result, the"
Bank judges that a reasonable range is around 1 to 2 per cent .

"Economic growth has resumed in the euro area, ending a six-quarter"
"recession. Real GDP rose by 1.1 per cent in the second quarter of 2013, a"
"significantly stronger result than anticipated in the July Report. Since then,"
survey indicators have suggested continued growth (Chart 6). The economic
"recovery is projected to proceed slowly, however, reflecting the need to"
"rebuild private sector balance sheets, ongoing fiscal consolidation, tight"
credit conditions and depressed labour markets.
While labour market competitiveness has improved in the euro-area periph-
"eral economies, substantial cross-country differences in growth prospects"
are expected to persist. A sustained recovery will require further progress in
"structural, fiscal and banking reforms (including a timely completion of the"
"banking union). As a result, uncertainty remains elevated, and the possibility"
"of an extended period of very slow growth, as well as financial system vul-"
"nerability, still represents a downside risk to the Bank’s outlook for the euro"
"area. However, the likelihood of that risk materializing has decreased."
Policy measures are expected to continue to support the
ongoing recovery in Japan
Japan registered a strong upturn in economic activity in the first half of
"2013. Real GDP growth averaged about 4 per cent over this period, sup-"
"ported by significant monetary and fiscal stimulus, a weaker yen, and"
improved confidence. Annual real GDP growth is expected to remain above
"the country’s production potential over the projection horizon, reflecting"
the effects of Japan’s ambitious program to revive economic growth and
end deflation.2 The pace of growth will nonetheless slow over 2014−15 as
"2	 The three-pronged program, commonly referred to as the “Three Arrows,” consists of: (i) the adoption"
of a 2 per cent inflation target by the Bank of Japan and aggressive monetary easing to reach this
goal within about two years; (ii) sizable fiscal stimulus in the near term followed by fiscal consolidation
"beginning in April 2014; and (iii) structural reforms, deregulation and trade promotion to boost the"
economy’s growth potential.

legislated increases in the value-added tax take effect. Inflation expecta-
tions have risen materially since the end of 2012 and core inflation is no
"longer negative, suggesting that deflationary pressures have abated."
Economic growth in China has picked up…
"Real GDP growth in China increased in the third quarter, supported by addi-"
tional fiscal stimulus and a re-acceleration of investment in manufacturing.3
"However, the continued reliance on investment activity, the rapid growth"
of credit and increases in housing prices have reinforced concerns about
financial stability and the sustainability of economic growth.
Real GDP growth through 2015 is projected to remain close to the gov-
ernment’s 2013 target of 7.5 per cent. Robust growth in productivity and
"income, underpinned by some progress on reform measures, should sup-"
port a gradual strengthening of private consumption and more sustainable
"investment activity. However, structural impediments such as the lack of"
social safety nets and overinvestment in the export sector will slow the
"rebalancing of the economy. Existing financial imbalances, together with the"
recent robust expansion in credit and excess capacity in a number of sec-
"tors, represent a downside risk to the Bank’s projection."
…but growth prospects have moderated in some other
emerging-market economies
Economic activity has slowed in some EMEs (Chart 7). To limit the depreciation
"of their currencies resulting from recent large capital outflows, authorities in"
some emerging-market countries have undertaken additional exchange rate
"interventions, introduced new capital controls and increased policy interest rates."
"In the near term, growth will continue to be held back by tighter financial condi-"
"tions and heightened uncertainty, as well as by persistent supply constraints."
"3	 In July, the Chinese government announced new fiscal measures that will suspend taxes on small"
"businesses, reduce fees and administrative burdens for exporters, and promote new funding sources"
for railway construction.

"Economic growth in EMEs is expected to pick up modestly over 2014−15,"
"driven by some stabilization in credit conditions, progress on the implemen-"
tation of structural reforms to alleviate supply bottlenecks and strengthening
"demand from the advanced economies. Nevertheless, the recent financial"
"market turbulence in EMEs, combined with existing domestic imbalances in"
"a number of countries, represents a downside risk to the Bank’s outlook."
"Despite recent declines, the Bank of Canada’s commodity price"
index remains elevated
"Commodity prices, as measured by the Bank of Canada’s commodity price"
"index (BCPI), have fallen by 6 per cent since July and are expected to remain"
"relatively flat over the projection horizon, with a drop in crude oil prices offset-"
"ting a projected rise in the price of non-energy commodities. On balance,"
"however, the BCPI remains elevated (Chart 8), underpinned by expectations"
of sustained demand from China and a continued recovery in the advanced
economies.
"As measured by the Brent benchmark, global crude oil prices are little"
"changed from their levels in July, while West Texas Intermediate (WTI) prices"
"have eased somewhat. Based on the latest futures curves, both Brent and"
WTI crude prices are assumed to decline by just under 15 per cent by the
"end of 2015, reflecting a continued robust increase in supply, especially"
"from non-conventional sources, and a reduction in geopolitical concerns"
(Chart 9). Prices for Western Canada Select (WCS) have fallen by more than
"20 per cent since the release of the July Report, owing to higher production"
"levels, ongoing transportation constraints and lower demand due to refinery"
"outages in North America. As a result, the spread between WTI and WCS"
prices has widened to approximately US$30 per barrel—the highest level
"since the beginning of 2013. Based on the latest futures curves, WCS prices"
"are expected to hover around current levels over the projection horizon,"
with the gap between WTI and WCS prices expected to narrow to about
US$20 per barrel.

Natural gas prices in North America have moved up modestly in recent
"months. The latest futures curves suggest that prices will increase further,"
"rising slightly above US$4 per million BTU by the end of 2015, owing to"
growing demand for electricity generation.
"In aggregate, non-energy commodity prices have stayed relatively flat since"
"July. Following a sharp correction over the April–June period, lumber prices"

Bank of Canada  •  Monetary Policy Report  •  October 2013
Summary
The projected acceleration in the growth of global demand should support
"a recovery of Canada’s exports, although the composition has changed."
"Weaker growth in U.S. output in the near term, particularly in business"
"and residential investment, will dampen Canadian exports relative to what"
had been expected in July. Elevated commodity prices should continue to
sustain the high level of investment in the resource sector in Canada and
support Canadian incomes.
The Canadian dollar has averaged roughly 97 cents U.S. since the
"September fixed announcement date, compared with the 96 cents U.S."
"assumed in the July Report (Chart 11). By convention, the Canadian dollar is"
assumed to remain at or near its current level over the projection horizon.

Canadian Economy
"Inflation in Canada has remained low in recent months, reflecting the sig-"
"nificant amount of slack in the economy, heightened competitiveness pres-"
sures in the retail sector and certain sector-specific factors (Chart 12). At the
"same time, uncertain global and domestic economic conditions are delaying"
"the pickup in Canada’s exports and investment. As a result, the current level"
of economic activity is now estimated to be lower than was anticipated in
"the July Report. While household spending remains solid, the continued"
slowing in the growth of household credit and the rise in mortgage interest
rates point to a gradual unwinding of household imbalances.
While some recent developments have not been as supportive as antici-
"pated, the Bank expects that a better balance between domestic and"
"foreign demand will be achieved over time, resulting in stronger and more"
self-sustaining economic growth. GDP growth is expected to surpass
that of potential output over the next two years as foreign activity and
"business confidence strengthen, and underlying momentum builds in the"
Canadian economy (Chart 13 and Table 2). The output gap in the base-case

Bank of Canada  •  Monetary Policy Report  •  October 2013
The pickup in exports and business investment is delayed
Real GDP is expected to have expanded at a slower pace in the third
quarter than anticipated in the July Report.4 This reflects weaker underlying
"momentum in exports and business fixed investment, as well as a smaller"
rebound from the temporary factors depressing growth in the second
quarter. This composition of aggregate demand is less favourable for
achieving sustainable growth.
"Following a rebound in the first quarter, the performance of the export"
"sector was lacklustre during the second and third quarters, with the excep-"
tion of automotive and forestry products (Chart 14). Aside from temporary
"disruptions in the oil sector, the recent weakness in exports is indicative of"
a broader trend of slower-than-expected export growth that began in early
"2012. As discussed in previous Reports, the weakness may be due to shifts"
in trade linkages that have been difficult to properly capture and to ongoing
competitiveness challenges.
The projected expansion of U.S. business and residential investment in
"2014 is still expected to fuel a rise in the growth rate of exports, albeit at a"
somewhat more moderate pace than expected in July. As economic activity
"improves, both in the United States and globally, exports of non-energy"
commodities such as metals and forestry products are projected to post
"strong gains. Following several disruptions in 2013, crude oil exports are also"
expected to contribute significantly to growth in 2014 as production continues
"to expand. Non-commodity exports such as machinery and equipment,"
"consumer goods (excluding automobiles), and services are also expected to"
"strengthen gradually, but at a slower pace than other export sectors."
4	 Real GDP growth over the second and third quarters has not been as uneven as the Bank anticipated in
July. The impact of flooding in southern Alberta and the construction strike in Quebec is now estimated
to have depressed growth in the second quarter by about 0.5 percentage points (compared with the 1.3
"percentage points projected in the July Report). The temporary nature of the shocks, together with the"
"reconstruction and repair of damaged infrastructure in Alberta, is now estimated to have boosted real"
GDP growth by only about 0.9 percentage points in the third quarter (compared with the 1.8  percentage
points anticipated in the July Report).

Bank of Canada  •  Monetary Policy Report  •  October 2013
A key assumption underlying this projection is that the historical relationship
between the growth rates of exports and foreign demand will gradually
reassert itself once the recovery is more fully entrenched. There is a risk that
"this could take longer than anticipated. However, there are some encour-"
aging signs that Canadian firms are taking steps to improve their export
performance. Available evidence suggests that many Canadian firms have
"already begun, or are planning, to expand exports to the fastest-growing"
"emerging markets.5 Similarly, through the Bank’s discussions with busi-"
"nesses for the Business Outlook Survey, a number of firms have reported"
that recent investments in innovation and marketing are supporting their
ability to sell in existing or new export markets. They also consider that
recent investments to improve efficiency or to lower costs are enhancing
competitiveness. As the demand for Canadian exports rises and firms fully
"utilize their capital, this should spur productive investments and work to"
improve competitiveness further.
"Against this backdrop, business investment is expected to strengthen, but"
"with a more subdued profile than in the July Report, in line with the lower"
"profile for exports. In particular, it is anticipated that business fixed invest-"
"ment will pick up over the next two years, consistent with historical relation-"
ships suggesting that business investment increases within about two to
four quarters following a rise in exports (Chart 15). This view is supported
"by responses to the Bank’s autumn Business Outlook Survey, which point"
to a growing number of firms reporting that they would face some difficulty
"meeting an unexpected increase in demand, since they are already using"
their existing labour and capital more intensively while awaiting signs that
demand is strengthening. This is consistent with firms having some ability
over the near term to accommodate strengthening demand but eventually
needing to expand capacity.
With firms currently waiting to see a sustained increase in demand before
"committing to investment plans, investment intentions remain relatively"
"subdued, even though indicators of business sentiment are close to their"
"historical averages (Chart 16). However, there are some early signs that"
"firms might be becoming more optimistic, since sentiment indicators have"
"generally improved from the levels observed earlier in 2013, and have been"

Bank of Canada  •  Monetary Policy Report  •  October 2013
Solid underlying conditions are also building a supportive foundation for
"investment. Corporate balance sheets are healthy, with low aggregate"
leverage and abundant levels of working capital. Despite higher long-term
"interest rates, financial conditions in Canada remain accommodative, given"
the considerable monetary stimulus currently in place (Chart 17). This is
underscored by responses to both the Bank’s Senior Loan Officer Survey
"and the Business Outlook Survey, which indicate that business-lending con-"
"ditions remain favourable (Chart 18). Indeed, there has been some firming"
"in business credit growth in recent months, including strong bond issuance,"
partly because firms are locking in at relatively low rates.
Household imbalances are expected to unwind gradually
Household expenditures (for both consumption and residential investment)
have been stronger than was anticipated in July. Consumption has been
"underpinned by an improvement in consumer confidence, together with"
"gains in employment and disposable income, and by the large financing"
incentives offered on purchases of automobiles. The recent vigour in resi-
dential investment may partly reflect activity that has been pulled forward
"in anticipation of higher interest rates on mortgages. However, the growth"
of household credit has continued to slow and is well below its historical
"average, consistent with a gradual unwinding of household imbalances"
(Chart 19). Market intelligence suggests that a number of contributing fac-
"tors, including a reduction in purchases by first-time homebuyers and larger"
"debt repayments, are also likely to be playing a role."
"Despite slowing growth in household credit, consumption is still expected"
"to increase at a moderate pace, in tandem with the expansion of disposable"
income (Chart 20). This profile is consistent with a high degree of consumer
"caution, which is reflected in a savings rate that is well above the average of"
the past decade.

Bank of Canada  •  Monetary Policy Report  •  October 2013
Credit conditions for households continue to be supportive of household
"expenditures, with effective borrowing rates at low levels. However, the"
increase in mortgage rates in recent months should exert a slight dampening
effect on residential investment over coming quarters.8 Residential investment is
therefore projected to decline from the current historically high levels toward a
"more sustainable position. The household debt-to-income ratio, which edged"
"up in the second quarter and is at a high level, should have a flat-to-lower"
"profile over the projection horizon. In the base-case projection, debt-service"
ratios will rise gradually but will remain low (Chart 21).
"8	 For example, the rate for a typical 5-year mortgage has risen by roughly 85 basis points since June."
The impact of the higher mortgage rates will be felt initially by first-time buyers and homeowners with
variable-rate mortgages (about one-third of homeowners). Many of those renewing their mortgages
now are still able to renegotiate their contracts at more favourable conditions than under their expiring
contracts.

Bank of Canada  •  Monetary Policy Report  •  October 2013
While the Bank expects household caution to dampen spending over the
"forecast horizon, it is possible that, with still-favourable borrowing condi-"
"tions, household expenditures could gather renewed momentum. The firm-"
ness in a range of housing market indicators in recent months reinforces this
"possibility. If the market strengthens further, it could increase the risk of a"
correction in house prices down the road.
Overall growth is expected to become more broadly based
"Relative to the July Report, the outlook for economic growth in Canada is"
"somewhat weaker over the projection horizon, owing to reduced contribu-"
tions from net exports and business investment (Table 2 and Table 3).
The Bank forecasts an improvement in the underlying momentum of the
economy through 2014 as external demand strengthens and business con-
"fidence rises. On an average annual basis, real GDP growth is projected to"
increase from 1.6 per cent in 2013 to 2.3 per cent in 2014 and 2.6 per cent
"in 2015. Given the degree of uncertainty inherent in projections, the Bank"
judges that GDP growth will likely be within ± 0.5 percentage points of the
"base-case projection in 2014, with a somewhat wider range in 2015 (see"
Box 1 on page 5).
The pickup in the economy is projected to be driven by a rebound in the
contribution of net exports. This dynamic is also expected to stimulate
a more solid contribution from business fixed investment over time. The
economy will continue to be supported by moderate growth in consumer
"spending, while residential investment will remain relatively flat, consistent"
with a convergence toward a more sustainable level of activity. Government
spending is expected to contribute only very marginally to real GDP growth
"over the projection horizon, in line with the plans of federal, provincial and"
local governments to consolidate spending to achieve fiscal balance.

Bank of Canada  •  Monetary Policy Report  •  October 2013
Potential output growth is projected to remain fairly stable
Potential output grew at a noticeably slower pace during the recession (see
"Appendix A). Since 2010, the growth of Canada’s production potential has"
"begun a gradual recovery, as trend labour productivity picked up with the"
strong rebound in business investment.9 Although much uncertainty sur-
"rounds estimates of potential output, the Bank projects that the profile for"
"business investment will lead to further capital deepening (i.e., more capital"
will be available to workers) and will contribute to continued improvements
"in trend labour productivity over the next couple of years. In this regard, the"
"expected rise in machinery and equipment investment, which has been rela-"
"tively weak in recent years, should support the future performance of labour"
"productivity. However, demographic factors, primarily the aging population,"
are expected to result in a slowdown in the growth rate of trend labour input
and to largely offset these other effects.
"On an average annual basis, potential GDP is expected to advance at a rate of"
"around 2 per cent over the projection horizon, with a range of ± 0.3 percentage"
points. This is slightly weaker than assumed in the previous projection.
The sizable amount of excess supply should be absorbed gradually
"Taking into account the various indicators of capacity pressures, the Bank"
judges that the amount of slack in the economy in the third quarter of 2013
was between 1 and 2 per cent. While this range for the output gap reflects
"the significant uncertainty surrounding any point estimate, the Bank is"
building the base-case economic projection using the midpoint of the range
"(i.e., 1.5 per cent). This is a somewhat greater degree of slack than expected"
"in the July Report, mainly because the level of real GDP in the third quarter"
was lower than anticipated by 0.4 per cent.
9	 Trends described in this section remove cyclical variation from the raw data.

Bank of Canada  •  Monetary Policy Report  •  October 2013
The Bank’s conventional measure suggests that the output gap was close
"to the lower end of the 1 to 2 per cent range (Chart 22).10 Moreover, recent"
"data from the Bank’s autumn Business Outlook Survey, which show that"
"the indicators of labour shortages and capacity pressures have increased,"
are consistent with a gap near the lower end of this range. In the present
environment of weak demand and ongoing uncertainty about future
"demand, firms are using existing capacity more intensively and waiting to"
make investments that would increase capacity. As they adjust their oper-
"ations to current needs, more firms are reporting some challenges finding"
workers with specific skills or for specific positions.
An alternative structural approach (see Appendix A) suggests that the
output gap is closer to 2 per cent in the third quarter. This reflects material
"slack in total hours worked, as well as a level of labour productivity that is"
considerably below its trend.11 Other labour market indicators also point
to a somewhat greater degree of slack than the conventional measure. For
"example, the proportion of involuntary part-time workers and the average"
"duration of unemployment are still elevated (Chart 23), and wage increases"
remain subdued (Chart 24).
With the projected profile for growth in real GDP exceeding the assumed
"growth of potential output over the next two years, the Bank expects that"
the economy will gradually return to full production capacity around the end
"of 2015. On balance, the economy is projected to operate with a slightly"
larger amount of slack over the next two years than was anticipated in the
July Report.
"10	 The conventional measure is based on the extended multivariate filter method (see L. Butler, “The Bank"
"of Canada’s New Quarterly Projection Model (QPM), Part 4. A Semi-Structural Method to Estimate"
"Potential Output: Combining Economic Theory with a Time-Series Filter,” Technical Report No. 77,"
"Bank of Canada, 1996."
"11	 The level of average hours worked continues to be below its trend, driven primarily by youth"
underemployment.

CPI inflation is expected to return slowly to target
Both core and total CPI inflation remain subdued (Chart 25). With a larger
and more persistent amount of excess supply in the economy than pro-
"jected in July, the return to target is now expected to take place somewhat"
later than previously anticipated.
Core inflation edged up from an average of 1.2 per cent in the second
quarter to an average of 1.3 per cent in the third quarter. Low core inflation
"continues to reflect persistent material excess capacity in the economy,"
heightened competitiveness pressures and certain sector-specific factors.

These factors include the impact of the unwinding of the sharp rise in global
"agricultural prices on core food prices, as well as lower auto insurance pre-"
miums in Ontario.
Various alternative measures of core inflation have all fallen to well below
2 per cent since the second half of 2012 (Chart 12).12 Abstracting from
"idiosyncratic developments that affect some of these measures, the Bank"
assesses underlying inflation to be around 1.5 per cent.
The estimated impact of temporary factors on inflation is subject to some
uncertainty. The Bank’s base-case projection assumes that these temporary
factors will gradually dissipate in coming quarters. Competitiveness pres-
sures in the retail sector are expected to continue to dampen the level of
"prices, although their effects on the inflation rate are expected to dissipate"
"in late 2014. With well-anchored inflation expectations, core inflation is"
projected to return slowly to 2 per cent around the end of 2015 as excess
capacity is absorbed.13
"Total CPI inflation also remains subdued, at just above 1 per cent on"
"average in the third quarter, up from an average of 0.7 per cent in the"
second quarter. This reflects not only the rise in core inflation but also firmer
"prices for a number of volatile components, notably gasoline. The lower level"
of total CPI inflation relative to core largely reflects downward pressure from
mortgage interest costs. Total CPI inflation is expected to return gradually to
target around the end of 2015.
12	 A new measure has recently been added to the Bank’s set of alternative measures of core inflation.
"Labelled the “common component” of CPI, the new measure is designed to extract the component of"
inflation that is common across all the individual series that make up the CPI. In contrast to some other
"alternative measures, it is not affected by sector-specific price movements. It also appears to capture"
"price movements that are indicative of fluctuations in aggregate demand in Canada. See M. Khan,"
"L. Morel and P. Sabourin, “The Common Component of CPI: An Alternative Measure of Underlying"
"Inflation for Canada,” Bank of Canada Working Paper No. 2013-35."
"13	 As previously assumed, the indirect effects associated with the restoration of the provincial sales tax in"
British Columbia are expected to have a minor effect on core inflation over the projection horizon (see
the April 2012 Monetary Policy Report).

Indicators of inflation expectations remain consistent with the Bank’s pro-
"jection, which shows inflation remaining below the 2 per cent target until"
"around the end of 2015. In this regard, the October Consensus Economics"
forecasts for total CPI inflation were 1.1 per cent in 2013 and 1.8 per cent in
"2014. According to the latest Business Outlook Survey, inflation expectations"
are little changed. While almost all firms expect CPI inflation to be within the
"Bank’s 1 to 3 per cent inflation-control range over the next two years, the"
majority expect it to remain in the bottom half of that range. A number of
firms cited the current lack of inflationary pressures and subdued demand
as factors driving their expectations. Market-based measures of longer-term
inflation expectations continue to be consistent with the 2 per cent inflation-
control target.
A reasonable range around the base-case projection for total inflation in 2014
is ± 0.3 percentage points (Box 1). This range is intended to measure ex ante
forecast uncertainty. A complement to this range is shown in Chart 26 and
Chart 27. These fan charts are derived using statistical analysis of ex post
errors from the Bank’s projection models. They depict the 50 per cent and
90 per cent confidence bands for year-over-year core inflation and total CPI
inflation from the fourth quarter of 2013 to the end of 2015.

Bank of Canada  •  Monetary Policy Report  •  October 2013
Risks to the Inflation Outlook
The fundamentals that drive the outlook for inflation are subject to several
risks emanating from both the external environment and the domestic
economy. The overall uncertainty surrounding the outlook is lower than it
"was a year ago, in part because the risks of some extreme events, such as"
"a reintensification of the euro-area crisis, are significantly lower. The Bank"
judges that the risks to the projected inflation path are roughly balanced.
The most important external risks are:
(i)
Stronger growth in advanced economies
More-robust economic growth than projected in the advanced
economies is the major upside risk to inflation in Canada. Once the
"drag from fiscal policy dissipates, the United States is poised for"
"faster growth, given the adjustments that have already occurred in"
the financial and household sectors. Growth in Europe and Japan
has been faster than expected. The combined effect might produce
a virtuous circle in which a more rapid recovery boosts confidence
that will feed back into demand. Greater global demand would in turn
"translate into higher exports for Canada, rising commodity prices"
"and an improvement in the terms of trade, which will support higher"
incomes and spending.
(ii)
A more protracted and difficult euro-area recovery
Despite the recent improvement in economic conditions in the euro
"area and the reduced risk of a reintensification of the euro-area crisis,"
labour ­
"markets remain severely stressed, and progress on critical"
reforms has been slow. This could lead to a more protracted and dif-
"ficult recovery, punctuated by renewed bouts of financial turbulence"
and uncertainty. Since Canada’s direct trade links to the euro area
"are limited, the effects would be felt mainly through confidence and"
"financial channels, as well as through indirect trade links."
The most important domestic risks are:
(i)
Weaker exports
Canada’s exports have been much weaker than anticipated and
only a portion of that weakness can be explained by slower growth
in foreign demand. While the base-case forecast assumes that the
wedge between the level of exports and foreign demand will persist
"over the projection period, there is a possibility that exports could be"
"even weaker than assumed. This risk could materialize if, for example,"
"competitiveness challenges are greater than anticipated, resulting"
in an even larger loss of market share than assumed for exports.
Reduced exports would likely translate into slower growth in business
""

""
""
Bank of Canada  •  Monetary Policy Report  •  October 2013
"investment, since there would be less need to expand capacity."
"Together, weaker exports and business investment would pose a"
downside risk to inflation.
(ii)
Domestic momentum builds faster than expected as confidence returns
Uncertainty about the strength of domestic and foreign demand is
weighing heavily on firms’ investment intentions. Once the recovery in
"foreign demand becomes more solidly entrenched, and with domestic"
"demand continuing to grow at a moderate pace, business sentiment"
"could improve rapidly. The sequence of stronger exports, rising confi-"
dence and increased investment could result in stronger overall growth
and is an upside risk to the inflation outlook.
(iii)
Disorderly unwinding of household sector imbalances
The elevated level of household debt and stretched valuations in some
segments of the housing market remain an important downside risk
to the Canadian economy. The continued slowing in household credit
growth and the rise in mortgage interest rates point to a gradual
"unwinding of household imbalances. However, recent data suggest"
some risk of renewed momentum in the housing market. This would
"provide a temporary boost to economic activity, but could exacerbate"
existing imbalances and therefore increase the probability of a cor-
rection later on. Such a correction could have sizable spillover effects
to other parts of the economy and to inflation.

Appendix A: Potential Output
This appendix provides details on how potential output is esti-
mated and an analysis of its likely evolution through to 2016.
Identifying the current level of potential output enables the
"Bank of Canada to estimate the output gap, and the projection"
of potential output growth sheds light on the prospects for
economic growth in Canada.
Estimating Potential Output
Potential output is the level of output that can be sustained
in an economy without adding to inflationary pressures.
Estimating potential output is difficult because it is not directly
"observable. The Bank therefore relies on various models,"
indicators and judgment to arrive at an estimate that includes
both historical and future growth. To help assess ­
potential
"output, estimates based on demographic cohorts and"
­
production functions are used. Such estimates incorporate
"(among other things) information about demographics,"
"wealth, investment and labour market developments. In the"
"process, potential output can be decomposed into separate"
analyses of trend labour input (total hours worked) and trend
labour productivity (real output per hour worked).
Potential Output Growth in Canada:
A Historical Perspective
The growth rate of potential output can vary significantly
"over time. In Canada, potential output growth over the past"
20 years can be divided into three distinct periods: the pickup
in the mid-to-late 1990s; the slowdown in the 2000s; and the
recession and beyond (Chart A-1).
The early 1990s were characterized by a significant strength-
ening in the growth rate of potential output. Beginning in
"about 1993, potential output began to increase with the"
start of the boom in technology production. Many new and
innovative companies appeared on the Canadian business
"landscape, and often became industry leaders in the develop-"
ment and production of information and communication
technologies (ICT). Both labour and capital flowed into this
"high-value-added industry, simultaneous with a productivity"
"boom that continued until 2000. Throughout this period, the"
growth of trend labour input remained stable.
"After 2000, productivity growth in Canada began a decline"
that would continue throughout the decade. The drop-off
"was characterized by weak investment in new technology,"
and a significant gap continued to exist between Canada and
the United States in terms of ICT stock per worker.1 With
"stable growth in trend labour input, this decline in labour"
­
productivity growth translated into a near one-for-one slow-
down in potential output growth.
1
The reasons behind Canada’s weak investment and poor productivity perform-
ance since 2000 are manifold. They range from the greater prevalence in Canada
than in the United States of small businesses that are less likely to invest in new
technologies to the role of the appreciation of the Canadian dollar in eroding the
"competitiveness of Canada’s exporters, and lags associated with the economy’s"
adjustment to commodity price shocks. It is also possible that U.S. firms took
more advantage of offshoring and outsourced the least-productive stages of
"production, which contributed to the growing productivity gap between the two"
"countries. Finally, there are measurement challenges for both output and prices"
(particularly in the resource and service sectors) that could be playing a role in the
decline in the growth rate of Canadian labour productivity.

Appendix A (continued)
The recent recession led to a sudden drop in the growth rate
"of potential output. Some businesses shut their doors, capital"
"was scrapped or left idle, and firms continued to use older"
"vintages of capital as investment dried up, precipitating a drop"
"in the trend labour productivity growth. Since the recession,"
there has been a small increase in trend labour productivity
"growth, reflecting a slow, but steady, recovery. Firms have yet"
"to make major investments in new, productivity-enhancing"
"machinery and equipment (M&E), but continue to undertake"
small upgrades that are improving productive capacity at the
"margin. Beginning around 2008, however, the effects of an"
aging population on labour supply also became more notice-
"able. As more baby boomers approach retirement age, there"
will likely be a persistent decline in the growth rate of trend
"labour input (hours worked), which will dampen potential"
output growth.
The Outlook: Where Is Potential Output Headed?
The growth rate of potential output is expected to remain
fairly stable at around 2 per cent in the next three years
"(Table A-1), since the projected pickup in the growth rate of"
trend labour productivity will be offset by a further decline in
the growth of trend labour input.

Note: Figures in parentheses correspond to October 2012 estimates.
The forecast for potential output growth has been revised
down slightly owing to lower-than-expected labour productivity
"growth in the last half of 2012 and the first half of 2013, as well"
as the delay in the expected pickup in demand for exports and
investment. Both of these factors have led to small downward
revisions to the profile for trend labour productivity growth
"throughout the projection period and, hence, to the projection"
"for potential output growth. Moreover, this revised forecast"
better balances the risks surrounding potential output growth.
The continued slowdown in the growth rate of trend labour
input over the projection period reflects a combination
of reduced employment rates associated with aging baby
boomers and a slowdown in the growth rate of new labour
"force entrants, owing to relatively low fertility rates over the"
past 20 years. Uncertainty surrounds the projection for trend
"labour input, particularly that related to the future participa-"
"tion rate and average hours worked by older workers, which"
will depend importantly on their financial situation.
Trend labour productivity growth is expected to rise throughout
"the projection period, reaching 1.4 per cent in 2015. Robust"
investment growth over the projection horizon will contribute
"to an acceleration in capital deepening, further building on the"
currently elevated ratio of investment relative to the capital stock
and the current high share of investment in GDP (Chart A-2).
"Since the recession, the relatively high level of investment"
spending has been supported primarily by investment in
"engineering in the mining, oil and gas sector (Chart A-2)."
"Relative to historical standards, investment remains weak in"
productivity-improving M&E and in research and develop-
ment (R&D). Investment in M&E contributes directly to
productivity through capital deepening. Both investment in
M&E and in R&D are also associated with the adoption of
new technologies and processes that have a further positive
effect on productivity.
As foreign activity and exports pick up over the projection
horizon and Canadian firms increase their investment in
"M&E, a rebound in the rate of labour productivity growth"
is expected through both of these channels. Other factors
that are expected to contribute to the recovery in the growth
of trend labour productivity are Canada’s highly educated
"workforce, which will enable the quick and efficient adoption"

"of new technologies, and the continued adjustment to the"
strong Canadian dollar as firms adapt to highly competitive
international markets and make the necessary investments to
become more productive.
A sensitivity analysis of the various assumptions on which the
projection is based suggests a range of growth of ±0.3 per-
"centage points around the base case. For instance, a plausible"
upper bound for potential output growth in 2014 is judged to
"be about 2.2 per cent, which assumes no slowdown in trend"
labour input growth from population aging relative to 2013
(0.8 per cent) and trend labour productivity of 1.4 per cent.
This is a significant increase from 1.1 per cent in 2013 and a
rate materially higher than the historical average of 1.1 per
"cent. On the downside, there could be a small outright decline"
in trend labour productivity growth (to 1 per cent) relative to
"2013, while the slowdown in trend labour input growth could"
"be more pronounced than anticipated, with a plausible lower"
"bound judged to be about 0.6 per cent. Together, these growth"
rates imply a growth rate for potential in 2014 of 1.6 per cent.
