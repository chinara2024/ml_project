Monetary Policy Report
Update
January 2007
This text is a commentary of the Governing Council of the Bank of Canada.
It presents the Bank’s updated outlook based on information received up to
16 January 2007.
Overview
The global economy has continued to ex-
"pand robustly. However, U.S. economic"
"growth slowed in 2006, with the weakness"
concentrated in the automotive and housing
sectors. This weakness does not appear to
have spread to the rest of the U.S. economy
"and, with signs that a significant amount of"
the adjustment in these sectors has already
"taken place, U.S. economic growth is expect-"
ed to pick up.
With reduced demand for Canadian ex-
"ports and the need to adjust inventories,"
output growth in Canada decelerated more
than had been expected in the October Re-
"port, likely averaging about 1.6 per cent in"
the second half of last year. The Bank judges
"that at the end of 2006, the Canadian econo-"
"my was operating at, or just above, its pro-"
duction capacity.
Looking
"ahead,"
real
GDP
growth
should average about 2 1/2 per cent in the
"first half of 2007, rising to about 2 3/4 per"
"cent in the second half. In 2008, growth is"
projected to stay in line with the growth of
"potential output (estimated at 2.8 per cent),"
keeping the economy operating near its ca-
pacity throughout the projection period.
With the weakness seen in the second half of
"2006, this growth profile implies average"
annual growth of 2.3 per cent in 2007 and
2.8 per cent in 2008.
Total consumer price inflation will con-
tinue to be affected by movements in energy
"prices and, during the first half of 2007, by"
last year’s reduction in the Goods and Services
Highlights
• The Canadian economy is judged to have
"been operating at, or just above, its"
"production capacity at the end of 2006,"
following weaker-than-expected growth
in the second half of the year.
• The Bank projects that the Canadian
economy should continue to operate near
its production capacity throughout 2007
and 2008.
• Total CPI inﬂation should average just
"above 1 per cent in the ﬁrst half of 2007,"
"returning to the 2 per cent target in 2008,"
while core inﬂation should return to 2 per
cent in the ﬁrst half of 2007 and remain
there.
• Risks to the Bank’s inﬂation projection
continue to be roughly balanced but have
diminished somewhat since the October
Report.
• The current level of the policy interest rate
"is judged, at this time, to be consistent"
with achieving the inﬂation target.

Tax (GST). If energy prices unfold in line
"with current futures prices, total CPI infla-"
tion should fall to about 1 per cent in the
"first half of 2007, returning to the 2 per cent"
target early in 2008. With the economy oper-
"ating near its production potential, and with"
slightly less upward pressure from housing
"prices, core inflation should return to 2 per"
cent in the first half of 2007 and stay there
throughout the projection period.
The Bank judges that the risks to its in-
flation projection are roughly balanced. The
main downside risk continues to be that
growth in the U.S. economy could be lower
than expected. The main upside risk comes
from rising house prices and increased
spending
related
to
borrowing
against
home equity. Both these upside and down-
side risks have diminished somewhat since
the October Report.
There remains a small possibility of a
"disorderly resolution of global imbalances,"
in the absence of further appropriate policy
actions internationally.
There also continues to be considerable
uncertainty about Canadian trend produc-
tivity growth. Recent productivity data
"have been weak, and it is unclear how much"
of that weakness is due to cyclical factors.
The Bank of Canada left the target rate
for the overnight rate unchanged at 4.25 per
cent on 5 December 2006 and 16 January
2007 (Chart 1). In line with the Bank’s out-
"look, the current level of the policy rate is"
"judged, at this time, to be consistent with"
achieving the 2 per cent inflation target over
the medium term.
Recent Economic and Financial
Developments
Global Developments
"Since the October Report, the global econom-"
ic expansion has remained robust. Economic
growth in the euro area over the past few
months has been slightly stronger than pro-
"jected, and growth in China continues to"
"outperform expectations. In Japan, business"
investment and exports remain vigorous
despite relatively weak household con-
"sumption. The stronger overseas demand,"
"particularly in business investment, along"
with a modest real effective depreciation of
"the U.S. dollar over the past year and a half,"
continues to support U.S. exports and is
consistent with the Bank’s assumption of an
orderly resolution of global imbalances.
With this continuing strength in global
"demand, commodity prices have remained"
high since the October Report. Oil and natu-
"ral gas prices have recently eased, however,"
owing to warmer-than-usual temperatures
in North America.
"After a strong start to 2006, real GDP"
growth in the United States moderated. This
mainly reflected a substantial downturn in
residential investment and reduced motor
"vehicle production. More broadly, the need"
to adjust inventory levels is also dampening
"manufacturing production, and business in-"
vestment is somewhat less buoyant than
previously expected. But adjustments in the
housing and auto sectors have not led to sig-
nificant spillover effects in the rest of the
U.S. economy. Household consumption has
"remained firm, supported by steady em-"
ployment gains in the services sector.

Canadian Economic Activity
With the slower growth in the U.S. econo-
"my, output growth in Canada has also de-"
"celerated. In the third quarter, real GDP grew"
at an annual rate of 1.7 per cent. While this
was slightly less than projected in our Octo-
"ber Report, the level of real GDP in the third"
quarter was as anticipated because of an up-
ward revision to growth in the first quarter.
"Based on available information, real GDP is"
likely to have grown by about 1.5 per cent in
"the fourth quarter of 2006, weaker than the"
2.8 per cent rate projected in the October
Report.
This slowdown in growth in the second
half of 2006 was largely due to reduced U.S.
demand for building materials and motor
vehicles—which
has
adversely
affected
Canada’s exports—and to the need for Ca-
nadian businesses to adjust inventories.
This inventory adjustment appears to have
"been related largely, but not entirely, to"
weaker U.S. demand for Canadian goods.
Final domestic demand remains the key
contributor to growth in Canada (Chart 2).
Strength in labour markets and real person-
"al disposable income, together with increas-"
es in household net worth and household
"credit,"
has
continued
to
support
solid
growth in consumer spending.

Estimated Pressures on Capacity
After reviewing all the indicators of capaci-
"ty pressures, it is the Governing Council’s"
judgment that the economy was operating
"at, or just above, its production capacity in"
the fourth quarter of 2006.
A number of indicators suggest that the
economy was operating above its produc-
tion capacity. In the Bank’s winter Business
"Outlook Survey, the percentage of companies"
reporting that they would have difficulties
in meeting an unanticipated increase in de-
mand was still above average (Chart 3). The
Bank’s conventional measure of the output
gap suggests that the economy was operat-
ing just above its production potential in the
fourth quarter.1 The employment-to-popu-
lation ratio remained very high in December
"compared with historical experience, and"
the unemployment rate was at a 30-year
low. The core rate of inflation has been
slightly above 2 per cent in recent months.
"On the other hand, the underlying trend"
increase in wages (based on average hourly
earnings of permanent workers) has eased
to a range of 2 1/2 to 3 1/2 per cent in recent
"months, after moving up earlier in 2006. As"
"well, the percentage of firms reporting la-"
bour shortages in the Bank’s winter survey
was slightly below average.
Inﬂation and the 2 Per Cent Target
"In recent months, total CPI inflation has been"
slightly lower than projected in the October
Report. The 12-month rate of increase in the
total CPI fell to just below 1 per cent in Sep-
tember and October 2006 (Chart 4).2 This
mainly reflected anticipated base-year ef-
fects associated with the hurricane-related
1.
The conventional estimates of production capacity in recent
"years have been revised down slightly, partly because of the"
impact of weak observed labour productivity growth on the esti-
mate of trend growth in labour productivity.
2.
Recall that the July 2006 reduction in the GST lowers total CPI
inﬂation by about one-half of a percentage point for a year.

"surge in energy prices in September of 2005,"
and unanticipated declines in the prices of
gasoline and natural gas. Total CPI inflation
moved up to 1.4 per cent in November as
the base-year effects dissipated.
"From September to November of 2006,"
the core rate of inflation averaged about
"2.2 per cent, up from 2 per cent in July and"
August. This increase was largely because
core prices for shelter and other services
"rose at a slightly faster rate, although more"
recently there are some indications of a
moderation in the rate of increase in hous-
ing prices. Decreases in the prices of many
import-intensive goods continued to put
downward pressure on core inflation.

The four-quarter change in the chain
price index for GDP eased from 3.0 per cent
in the second quarter of 2006 to 1.4 per cent
"in the third quarter, reflecting a further"
reduction in Canada’s terms of trade. This
caused further moderation in the year-to-
year increase in nominal GDP.
Financial Markets and Credit
Conditions
"Long-term interest rates, market volatility,"
and credit spreads have remained low in
"most countries. In addition, many equity in-"
dexes have recently recorded either multi-
year or all-time highs.
"Against this backdrop, financing condi-"
tions in Canada remain favourable. Finan-
cial institutions and markets continue to be
"willing to lend, since business profitability"
and overall financial health remain strong.
Growth of business credit is near its histori-
"cal average, and the modest decline experi-"
enced since early 2006 likely reflects a slight
moderation in demand rather than a tight-
ening in the supply of credit. The pace of
growth in household credit remains well
"above its historical average, although it has"
declined somewhat since the last Report. This
strong growth has been partly associated with
borrowing against home equity. Growth
rates of the narrow and broad monetary ag-
gregates have continued to increase.
"Over the past three months, the Canadi-"
an dollar has moved from a high of
89.5 cents U.S. to a low of close to 84.5 cents
"U.S. This reflects a number of factors, in-"
cluding the recent weakness in energy prices
and an unwinding of support from cross-
border currency flows related to mergers
and acquisitions.
The Economic Outlook
The Bank’s base-case projection incorpo-
rates the following key assumptions: en-
ergy prices evolving in line with current
"futures prices, a gradual real effective"
"depreciation of the U.S. dollar, and a"
MONETARY POLICY REPORT UPDATE: JANUARY 2007
5
Canada/U.S. exchange rate in the range
"of 84.5 to 87.5 cents U.S., evident since the"
December interest rate announcement.
The robust expansion of the global econ-
omy is still expected to decelerate to a more
sustainable rate over 2007–08. As in the
"October Report, global economic growth is"
projected to ease from 5.1 per cent in 2006 to
"4.7 per cent in 2007, and to 4.5 per cent in 2008."
In the base-case scenario for the U.S.
"economy, real GDP growth is expected to re-"
cover to the rate of growth in potential out-
put in the second half of 2007 before moving
slightly above potential growth through
"2008. On an annual basis, growth is project-"
ed to be 2.5 per cent in 2007 and 3.2 per cent
in 2008 (very close to the projection in the
October Report).
Futures prices for crude oil and natural
gas are lower than those in the October Re-
"port, with prices for crude oil moving up"
from current levels of about US$53 per bar-
rel to about US$59 on average in 2007 and
about US$63 in 2008. The price index for
non-energy commodities is still expected to
decrease modestly over the projection peri-
od from the very high levels reached to-
wards the end of 2006.
In the Bank’s base-case projection for
"Canada, economic growth picks up through"
"2007,"
with
quarterly
growth
averaging
about 2 1/2 per cent at annual rates in the
first half of the year and about 2 3/4 per
cent in the second half. Together with the
weaker growth experienced in the second
"half of 2006, this implies annual average"
"growth for 2007 of 2.3 per cent. For 2008,"
growth is projected to continue at a pace of
"2.8 per cent, in line with the growth of po-"
tential output. This implies that the econo-
my would continue to operate near its
production capacity throughout the entire
projection period.
Strong domestic demand in Canada
continues to be a key feature of the base-case
projection (Table 1).
"However, Canadian export growth is"
"expected to remain weak in the near term,"
recovering gradually through 2007 and
"2008. At the same time, pronounced gains in"
investment in machinery and equipment
should boost imports further. Consequent-
"ly, net exports should continue to exert a"
considerable drag on overall growth in
"2007, with this effect diminishing over the"
projection period.
The inventory adjustment evident in the
second half of 2006 is expected to be largely
"completed early in 2007 and, therefore,"
would no longer subtract from growth.

The projection for core inflation is little
changed from that in the October Report.
With the economy expected to remain close
to its production potential and with easing
"housing price pressures, core inflation is ex-"
pected to return to 2 per cent in the first half
of 2007 and remain there throughout the
projection period.
"In 2007, movements in the 12-month rate"
of increase in the total CPI will be importantly
influenced by the GST cut in July 2006 and by
"developments in the markets for crude oil,"
"gasoline, and natural gas. Total CPI inflation"
is expected to average just above 1 per cent
"in the first half of 2007, before returning to"
the 2 per cent target by early 2008 (Table 2).
The current level of the policy rate is
consistent with achieving the 2 per cent in-
flation target in this base-case projection.
