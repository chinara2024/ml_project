Bank of Canada lowers target for the
overnight rate by 1/4 percentage point to 2
per cent
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Media Relations
"Ottawa, Ontario"
"April 13, 2004"
The Bank of Canada today announced that it is lowering its target for the
overnight rate by one-quarter of one percentage point to 2 per cent. The
"operating band for the overnight rate is correspondingly lowered, and the Bank"
Rate is now 2 1/4 per cent.
The Canadian economy continues to adjust to developments in the global
"economy. These include stronger world demand, higher commodity prices, the"
"realignment of world currencies, including the Canadian dollar, and the intensified"
"competition, together with the new trading opportunities, coming from emerging-"
market economies. These developments require shifts in activity among sectors
and create a need for adjustments by many businesses. Monetary policy is
"facilitating these adjustments by supporting aggregate demand, with the goal of"
keeping the economy near its full potential and inflation on target.
The Bank's outlook for economic growth and inflation remains essentially
unchanged from the outlook published in the January Monetary Policy Report
Update. The economy is projected to return close to its production potential by
the third quarter of 2005 and core inflation is projected to move back to the 2 per
cent target by the end of 2005.
"Against this backdrop, the Bank decided to lower the target for the overnight rate"
by a further quarter percentage point.
The risks to the outlook now appear balanced. An elaboration of the Bank's views
on the outlook for inflation and the economy will be provided in the Monetary
"Policy Report, to be released on 15 April 2004."
Information note:
The Bank of Canada's next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate
target is 8 June 2004.
