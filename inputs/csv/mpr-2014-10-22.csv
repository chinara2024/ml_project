Global Economy
The outlook for economic growth is diverging across regions and remains
reliant upon exceptional monetary policy stimulus. Private and public sector
"debt are now at even higher levels than before the global financial crisis, while"
weak global growth prospects have undermined debt-servicing capacity
(Chart 1). The resulting deleveraging continues to be an important headwind to
"global growth. Another headwind is the low confidence in economic prospects,"
"which has dampened business investment and world trade. In this context,"
"a substantial decline in oil prices, reflecting increased supply together with"
"weaker demand prospects, has lowered the profile for Canada’s terms of trade."
"Despite these headwinds, as progress is made on deleveraging and con-"
"fidence improves, global GDP growth is expected to pick up from about"
3 per cent in 2014 to 3 1/2 per cent in 2015 and 2016. This global profile is
weaker than the projections in the July Monetary Policy Report (Table 1).
"In those advanced economies, such as the United States, where the policy"
response to the global financial crisis and subsequent recession was more
"aggressive and sustained, the recovery is more robust, as private deleveraging"
"and fiscal consolidation are mainly complete. In contrast, the recoveries in"
the euro area and Japan have lost momentum as those regions struggle to

overcome persistent headwinds and structural impediments to growth. A key
concern for the global projection is the extent to which the U.S. recovery may
be restrained by slower growth in other regions—repeating the serial dis-
appointments that have plagued the global economy since the crisis (Chart 2).
Financial conditions remain accommodative despite the
recent deterioration in market sentiment
Highly accommodative monetary policies are contributing to the economic
recoveries in many countries and have underpinned developments in finan-
cial markets. Long-term bond yields in North America have declined and
"in Japan are close to historical lows, as they were at the time of the July"
"Report. European bond yields have also declined to unusually low levels,"
"in response to disappointing GDP growth, falling inflation expectations and"
further monetary easing (Chart 3).

"Market sentiment has deteriorated in recent weeks, as evidenced by a"
"repricing of riskier assets. Even with this repricing, however, financial condi-"
"tions remain accommodative. Credit spreads, especially in the lower-rated"
"credits, as well as bond spreads for emerging markets, have widened from"
"their recent compressed levels, but remain tight by historical standards"
(Chart 4). Although recent declines in global stock market indexes have
"erased all of this year’s strong gains, there has still been a considerable"
reaccumulation of wealth over the post-crisis period. While volatility has
also risen across various markets from the subdued levels reached in the
"summer, it remains low by historical standards for most asset classes."
"In light of the uneven global recovery, monetary policies may diverge further"
across regions in the period ahead. After aggressively expanding its balance
"sheet, the U.S. Federal Reserve is expected to announce the end of its asset"

"purchases in October (Chart 5). In contrast, the Bank of Japan is continuing"
"to expand its balance sheet, and the European Central Bank (ECB) undertook"
further actions in September to support economic growth in the euro area.1
Market expectations for future policy rates imply different paths for monetary
policy across regions (Chart 6).
The divergence in market-implied monetary policy paths and expected
"economic growth rates is, to some extent, contributing to the strength of the"
"U.S. dollar, which has appreciated since the July Report against a number"
"of currencies, including the Canadian dollar."
1	 These actions include conducting targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs) and pur-
chasing private asset-backed securities and covered bonds to return its balance sheet to levels last
seen in 2012. The ECB also lowered its main policy rates.

Headwinds are diminishing in some advanced economies
Momentum in the U.S. economy is strengthening. Economic growth has
rebounded from a negative first quarter as the effects of temporary and
"one-off factors—including a harsh winter, a marked drop in exports and a"
"large inventory correction—were reversed. Nonetheless, labour resources"
"remain significantly underutilized and wage gains have been modest, sug-"
gesting that there is still a fair degree of slack in the economy.
Real GDP growth in the United States is projected to pick up in the second
half of 2014 to average close to 3 per cent over 2015–16. Based on the
"past dispersion of private sector forecasts, U.S. economic growth in 2015"
is anticipated to be within ±0.5 percentage points of the Bank’s ­
"projection,"
"with a somewhat wider range in 2016. For the first time since 2010, fiscal"
"headwinds have abated. In fact, government spending is expected to"
contribute positively to GDP growth in 2014 and beyond. Deleveraging by
households and businesses appears to be largely complete. Consumption
growth is expected to be underpinned by gains in household wealth and
"employment, as well as by lower commodity prices. Indeed, the lower"
assumed oil price (compared with the July Report) is estimated to raise
the level of U.S. GDP by 0.2 to 0.4 per cent over the projection horizon.
A sharp rise in mortgage rates in the middle of 2013 and the relatively weak
rate of new household formation have resulted in disappointing housing
"activity over the past year. However, ongoing improvements in the labour"
market and favourable demographics are expected to lead to a rebound in
"household formation, boosting residential construction in 2015–16 (Chart 7)."
"Meanwhile, in response to increased confidence and rising demand, business"
investment is growing more rapidly.

Note: Household formation is taken from the Housing Vacancy Survey. Data for 2014 are imputed by setting
the year-over-year growth rate in 2014H2 equal to the average year-on-year growth rate in 2014H1. In the
"forecast, younger (<35) age-groups maintain their 2013 headship rates, while headship rates for older age"
groups maintain long-term trends.

"As growth becomes self-sustaining, the output gap narrows and inflation"
"pressures firm, the U.S. economy is expected to gradually become less"
reliant on accommodative monetary policy.
"In contrast to the situation in the United States, the recoveries in the euro"
"area and Japan remain fragile as deleveraging, underlying structural deficien-"
cies and labour market challenges continue to restrain growth. Employment
in both regions has yet to return to pre-crisis levels (Chart 8). Credit growth in
the private sector continues to decline in the euro area and remains relatively
low in Japan (Chart 9).
The recovery in the euro area stalled in the second quarter of 2014. Substantial
"excess supply, slowing growth and persistently low inflation have led to a"
"fall in inflation expectations, representing a significant downside risk to the"
modest recovery in the region.

"Over the next two years, real GDP growth in the euro area is expected to"
average roughly 1 per cent. The recovery will be supported by rising world
"demand, the ECB’s recently announced policies, a relatively weak currency"
and ongoing structural reforms.
"In Japan, growth fell sharply in the second quarter of this year. While a decline"
was anticipated in the wake of an increase in its value-added tax (VAT) in
"April, subsequent data suggest that the Japanese economy remains weaker"
"than previously expected. Despite considerable monetary accommodation,"
"growth is expected to remain modest through 2016, as consumption demand"
continues to be restrained by weak real disposable household incomes
and another VAT increase planned for 2015. The depreciation of the yen is
anticipated to lead to higher demand for domestically produced goods and
an eventual improvement in Japan’s external accounts.
Economic prospects are also diverging across
emerging markets
"Following a particularly weak first quarter, growth in China picked up strongly"
"in the second and third quarters, largely because of an improvement in net"
exports. The Bank expects real GDP growth in China to average around
"7 per cent over 2014–16, supported by broadly accommodative monetary"
"policy, targeted fiscal measures as authorities work to rebalance the"
"economy, and lower oil prices. However, activity in China’s housing market"
"continues to decelerate, with high and rising inventories and declining prices"
and sales (Chart 10).
Growth profiles have diverged across other major emerging-market econ-
omies (EMEs). India and Indonesia are benefiting from successful political
"transitions, and structural reforms in Mexico are fostering robust growth."
"In contrast, the economies of Brazil, Russia and Turkey are much weaker,"
partly as a result of political or geopolitical tensions.
The Bank projects that growth in EMEs will strengthen gradually through 2016
as financial conditions remain supportive and as several countries complete
political transitions. Reform-oriented governments are expected to implement
structural changes that will remove impediments and encourage growth.

Commodity prices have fallen with shifts in both supply
and demand
"Despite rising geopolitical tensions, global crude oil prices have fallen"
since the July Report and are now at their lowest level in about four years
(Chart 11). The Bank estimates that about two-thirds of the decline is likely due
"to increased supply, particularly from Libya and from U.S. shale oil production,"
with the remainder coming from weaker actual and anticipated global demand
(Chart 12). The price of Western Canada Select (WCS) has declined by less
"than that of global crude, reflecting an increase in the capacity to transport oil"
out of Western Canada by rail and solid demand for heavy oil.
"By convention, the Bank assumes that energy prices will remain near their"
"recent levels. The U.S.-dollar prices for Brent, West Texas Intermediate"
"(WTI) and WCS have recently averaged roughly $90, $85 and $70 per barrel,"
respectively. These prices are $15 to $20 lower than had been assumed in
the July Report.
The outlook for oil is subject to considerable two-sided risks. The prospect
of price competition among some major producers poses a downside risk.
"That being said, the fiscal break-even oil price for OPEC members and high"
marginal supply costs for unconventional oil should provide a medium-term
price floor of around $75 to $80 for Brent.2 Despite the sharp fall in the spot
"price, the longer end of the futures curve has remained firm since the con-"
"flict in Iraq began in early June, reflecting market participants’ concerns that"
events in Iraq could have a negative effect on supply over the longer term.
Prices of non-energy commodities have softened since the July Report.
Agricultural prices are lower as a result of a record grain harvest and the
smaller-than-expected impact on pork supplies of a virus affecting piglets.
"Beef prices, however, remain elevated. Base metals prices have fallen by"
"about 6 per cent since the July Report, owing to concerns about prospects"
"for demand from China. Nevertheless, the prices of non-energy commodities"
2	 The fiscal break-even price for oil is the average price some OPEC members need to balance their
budgets at current levels of production in a given year.

"remain roughly in line with levels at the beginning of the year, since increases"
in base metals and livestock prices (due to supply-side constraints) have
been offset by a decline in lumber prices.
Non-energy commodity prices are expected to ease even further through
early 2015 as a steady decline in the prices of agricultural products more
than offsets an anticipated increase in prices for lumber and base metals.
Prices should begin to recover later on as the global economy gains strength.
"Relative to the July Report, the profile for the Bank of Canada’s commodity price"
index has fallen by more than 10 per cent. Prices for energy and non-energy
"commodities are now lower by about 15 per cent and 5 per cent, respectively."
Summary
"While the global outlook has been downgraded, growth is expected to gain"
"momentum, in part because of solid growth in private sector demand in"
the United States. Canada should benefit from the growing strength of its
"major trading partner (Table 1). However, commodity prices have retreated"
"considerably since the July Report. As a result, Canada’s terms of trade have"
also declined and are now projected to be about 6 per cent lower through
2015 and 2016 than was anticipated at the time of the July Report (Chart 13).3
"The Canadian dollar has depreciated since the July Report. By convention,"
the Canadian dollar is assumed to remain at its recent average level of
"89 cents over the projection horizon, lower than the 93 cents assumed in"
July (Chart 14).
3	 Part of the shock to the terms of trade is a reassessment of the feed-through of energy prices to import
prices.

Canadian Economy
Inflation in Canada is close to the 2 per cent target. Core inflation rose more
"rapidly than anticipated in July, mainly reflecting unexpected sector-specific"
"factors. Meanwhile, total CPI inflation is evolving broadly as anticipated, as"
the pickup in core inflation was largely offset by lower-than-expected energy
prices. The Bank continues to judge that underlying inflationary pressures
"are muted, given the persistent slack in the economy and the continued"
effects of competition in the retail sector.
Economic activity in Canada is currently supported by the lower Canadian
"dollar and the ongoing low interest rates, which are continuing to help offset"
headwinds that include the impact of uncertainty and weak global demand.
Household spending still represents more than its long-run sustainable share of
"growth, and a rotation away from household spending toward business invest-"
"ment and exports is essential. Exports have been gaining traction, in line with"
"the growing momentum in the U.S. economy, but investment remains weak."
"Over time, as global headwinds recede, confidence in the sustainability of"
"domestic and global demand should gradually improve, and the contribution"
of business investment should pick up. Together with a moderation in the
"growth of household spending, this is expected to gradually return Canada’s"
economy to a more balanced growth path.
Real GDP growth is projected to average close to 2 1/2 per cent over the
"next year before slowing gradually to around 2 per cent by the end of 2016,"
roughly the estimated growth rate of potential output. The outlook for
"growth in Canada is about the same as in July, with the impacts of various"
global developments largely offsetting one another. The strengthening U.S.
economy and weaker Canadian dollar are providing support for Canada’s
"non-energy exports. However, the lower level of global crude oil prices"
and the resulting weaker terms of trade are projected to reduce Canadian
incomes and to weigh on household and business spending.
"As the economy reaches its full capacity in the second half of 2016, both core"
and total CPI inflation are projected to be about 2 per cent on a sustained basis.
Underlying inflationary pressures remain muted
Both core and total CPI inflation are now close to 2 per cent. A significant por-
tion of the rise in inflation since the beginning of the year reflects the temporary
effects of exchange rate pass-through and other sector-specific factors.
The depreciation of the Canadian dollar since the beginning of 2013 has
put some temporary upward pressure on inflation as higher import prices
have been “passed through” to domestic consumer prices. The magnitude
and timing of the direct impact of the exchange rate on core inflation are
difficult to measure with precision. The impact varies across businesses
""

Bank of Canada  •  Monetary Policy Rep ort  •  Oct

"and depends on a number of factors, including the state of competition in"
"individual sectors, the degree of import concentration and the duration of"
currency hedges. The pass-through can be inferred by examining the evolu-
tion of inflation for goods with high import content. Since the beginning of
"the year, core goods with higher import content—particularly clothing—have"
registered larger price increases than those with lower import content.
The depreciation of the Canadian dollar appears to be adding about 0.1 to
0.3 percentage points to core inflation at this point. Since some of the key
volatile components excluded from the core measure are more sensitive
"to exchange rate movements, the pass-through to total CPI inflation is"
"estimated to be larger, at about 0.3 to 0.5 percentage points.4 In the Bank’s"
"base-case projection, the direct effect of the lower dollar on the level of"
"prices is assumed to be largely complete by around mid-2015. As a result,"
the impact on year-over-year inflation should dissipate by mid-2016.
Sector-specific factors continue to provide temporary boosts to measured
"inflation. Driven by telephone and Internet services, prices for communica-"
tions registered one of the largest monthly gains on record in August. On a
"year-over-year basis, prices were up 8.9 per cent in September, the highest"
rate of increase since the early 1980s. Meat prices rose 11.5 per cent year-
"over-year in September, the highest rate since mid-1987. Increases in meat"
"prices are expected to moderate, since prices have risen by more than"
"would be consistent with the typical pass-through from commodity prices,"
"and hog prices have recently retreated somewhat. More generally, above-"
average inflation since the beginning of the year has been concentrated in
"categories that tend to exhibit low inflation persistence (Chart 15)—hence,"
inflation rates in these categories are expected to decrease in the near term.
4	 The core CPI and the eight components excluded from core each contribute about 0.2 percentage points
to total CPI inflation as a result of the depreciation of the dollar. The latter category mainly reflects the
"impact of the exchange rate on gasoline prices. Over the same period, the decline in oil prices measured"
"in U.S. dollars has contributed to reduce total CPI inflation by about 0.4 percentage points. As a result, the"
net contribution of gasoline prices to total CPI inflation is about -0.2 percentage points.

"Looking through these temporary effects, persistent excess capacity in the"
economy and heightened competition in the retail sector are continuing to
"exert downward pressure on inflation. The Bank estimates that, together,"
these two factors are currently subtracting about half a percentage point
from the annual rate of core inflation.
Alternative measures of core inflation have generally picked up since the
"beginning of the year. The common component, which is well suited to"
"seeing through one-off isolated price increases, has remained close to"
1 1/2 per cent (Chart 16).
Material slack remains in the economy
Canadian economic activity in the first half of the year has evolved broadly
as anticipated. Stronger-than-expected growth in the second quarter of
2014 was partly offset by a downward revision to first-quarter growth.
Growth was boosted by the dissipation of temporary factors that had
depressed activity earlier in the year and was underpinned by a surge in
"non-energy exports and solid household spending. In contrast, business"
investment contracted for the third consecutive quarter. Real GDP in the
third quarter is estimated to have increased by about 2 1/4 per cent to
approximately the level that was anticipated in the July Report.
There is considerable uncertainty around estimates of economic slack. While
almost all indicators that the Bank monitors continue to point to excess cap-
"acity, they differ widely in the signals they provide on the magnitude of current"
slack. The Bank uses three main approaches to assess overall production-
"based capacity pressures in the economy: the conventional measure, the"
integrated framework and the Business Outlook Survey. The conventional
measure suggests that there is currently a modest degree of slack in the

"economy, which reappeared after growth slowed in mid-2011 (Chart 17). In"
"contrast, the integrated framework, which incorporates demographic details"
"as well as macroeconomic data, suggests that excess capacity has fluctu-"
"ated between 1 per cent and 2 per cent for more than three years.5 Finally,"
responses to the Business Outlook Survey are interpreted to be consistent
with persistent excess capacity since mid-2012. As firms have been waiting
"for signs of a sustained strengthening in demand before expanding capacity,"
they have reported aligning operating capacity to weak market conditions and
relying more heavily on existing capacity to meet fluctuations in demand.
Another way of assessing the slack in the economy is to separately examine
"unused capacity in the two main factors of production, i.e., labour input and"
"capital (Box 1). In general, labour market indicators point to a larger degree"
"of slack than production-based measures. Using the integrated framework,"
"we estimate, for example, that the labour input gap is currently around"
-1 3/4 per cent.
While the unemployment rate declined quite rapidly from late 2009 to late
"2011, to about 7 per cent, and has remained fairly stable since then, it likely"
overstates the post-recession improvement in the labour market and the
"current degree of utilization of resources. For one thing, the participation"
rate has fallen markedly in the past year—by roughly double what demo-
graphic shifts would suggest. Notwithstanding the recent pickup in employ-
"ment, total hours worked are essentially flat, and the share of full-time"
"5	 The integrated framework (IF) is based on the growth accounting framework, which decomposes"
potential GDP into contributions coming from trend labour input (hours worked) and trend labour pro-
"ductivity (output per hour worked). On the trend labour input side, the IF uses an empirical model that"
"largely depends on demographic developments, as well as other factors such as school enrolment and"
"disincentives linked with employment insurance. On the trend labour productivity side, the approach"
links the capital stock with investment to identify trend capital deepening and uses a combination of
filters and detailed analysis of variables such as investment in machinery and equipment and research
and development to estimate trend total factor productivity.

"employment has been trending down. As well, the elevated proportion of"
"involuntary part-time workers (roughly 930,000 workers on average over"
"the past year), the average duration of unemployment (Chart 18), and weak"
growth in unit labour costs all point to the persistence of significant excess
supply. A more comprehensive labour market indicator estimated by the
Bank also suggests that the unemployment rate may have overstated the
extent of improvements in labour markets (Chart 19).6

There is less evidence of excess productive capital in the Canadian
economy in the wake of a decade-long period of structural adjustment
to competitiveness challenges punctuated by a global economic reces-
"sion. Over this extended period, the capital stock in Canada benefited"
"from strong investment in the mining, oil and gas sector but also faced"
contractionary forces as some capacity in other sectors was permanently
"withdrawn from production, and there was limited investment in new cap-"
acity. Faced with ongoing uncertainty about the outlook for global economic
"growth, firms have generally been reluctant to invest to expand capacity,"
focusing instead on investments to improve competitiveness or to repair
"existing capital stock. As a result, capacity utilization has increased and is"
currently close to its historical average.

Taking into account the various indicators of capacity pressures and
"the uncertainty surrounding any point estimate, the Bank judges that"
the amount of excess capacity in the third quarter was between 1/2 and
1 1/2 per cent.7
Economic activity remains heavily dependent on
monetary policy stimulus
The level of economic activity and the corresponding degree of slack are
"influenced by many factors, including the stance of monetary policy. In"
"particular, the difference between the current policy rate and the neutral rate"
is an important determinant of the degree of support that policy is providing
to economic activity (Box 2).
With policy rates currently well below their estimated neutral levels in
"Canada and the United States, monetary policy in both countries remains"
highly stimulative. This stimulus is needed to offset the considerable head-
winds faced by both countries. The Bank estimates that if the policy rate
had been at its neutral level in both Canada and the United States since late
"2010 and the Federal Reserve had not embarked on quantitative easing, the"
output gap in Canada would have been -5 1/2 per cent in the third quarter
"of this year. With so much excess capacity in the economy, core inflation"
would have fallen to well below 1 per cent. Housing and durables consump-
"tion, including auto sales, have benefited the most from this policy stimulus,"
"with the latter estimated to be about 280,000 vehicles higher in 2014 than if"
the policy rate were at neutral in Canada and the United States. Canadian
exports have also benefited indirectly through the impact of lower U.S.
interest rates on U.S. consumption and investment spending.
7	 The projection is constructed around the midpoint of the range for the output gap in the third quarter of
"2014 (i.e., -1 per cent)."

The Bank’s estimate of the neutral rate is subject to considerable uncertainty. A
neutral rate different than the one currently assumed by the Bank would affect
the outlook for economic activity and inflation. A lower level for the neutral rate
would imply less policy stimulus than currently assumed and a risk of infla-
tion not returning to target on a sustainable basis over the projection horizon.
"Symmetrically, a higher neutral rate would risk an overshoot of the target."
Exports appear to be gaining traction
"Canadian exports surged in the second quarter, supported by stronger"
U.S. investment spending and the past depreciation of the Canadian dollar.
Recent data point to a further gain in exports in the third quarter.
"The pickup in exports has been fairly broad-based across sectors, with"
additional gains in energy and solid growth in exports of non-energy goods
"(Chart 20). Part of the growth in non-energy components (e.g., passenger"
"cars and light trucks, motor vehicle parts, and intermediate food products)"
"reflects a rebound from a very weak first quarter. However, there is now"
"evidence of more sustained growth in several other components, including"
"machinery and equipment, fabricated metal products, and building and"
packaging materials.
The Bank expects export growth to continue as foreign activity strengthens
and the competitiveness of Canadian firms benefits from a lower Canadian
"dollar. The level of exports is higher than projected in July, consistent with"
the increased levels observed recently and the higher projected level for U.S.
activity through next year. This view is also supported by the results of the
"Bank’s autumn Business Outlook Survey, which indicate that exporters have"
seen more tangible signs of improving sales growth and are anticipating an
"acceleration of foreign sales. Nevertheless, the export profile is still much"
"weaker than in previous cycles, and downside risks remain (Chart 21)."
"To a large extent, the export profile reflects the weakness of the global"
"recovery. But, as the Bank emphasized in previous Reports, it also reflects"
competitiveness challenges and structural issues. Recent staff analysis

using highly disaggregated export data has shed additional light on these
issues. It suggests that capacity in a number of sectors has declined
significantly since 2000. Within the broad export categories identified as
underperforming relative to others (16 of the 31 non-energy export cat-
"egories), about one-quarter of the subsectors (about 500 out of 2,000) have"
registered export declines of more than 75 per cent since 2000. More than
one-third of this decrease is accounted for by a decline in exports of heavy
"trucks. Other subsectors with notable declines include rail locomotives,"
"wooden furniture, knitted fabrics, small passenger cars and kraftliner paper."
"Anecdotal evidence, including numerous media reports of production facility"
"closures, suggests that those declines reflect structural or competitiveness"
"issues, and therefore represent lost productive capacity."

When compared with a scenario in which exports of these products would
"have risen in line with foreign activity, there is a gap equivalent to about"
"$30 billion (in real terms) by 2013, or a 7 per cent reduction in total non-"
energy exports in 2013. The weakness in these sectors can also explain
almost 40 per cent of the poor performance of non-energy exports relative
to foreign activity since 2000 (Chart 22).
Investment spending is lagging the improvement in exports
Business investment has been very weak recently. While an increasing
"number of export sectors appear to be turning the corner toward recovery,"
only when this pickup is perceived as sustainable will it translate into the
"higher business spending required to return the economy to sustainable,"
"balanced growth (Chart 23). At the same time, there are downside risks"
"related to the possibility of persistently weaker commodity prices, which"
"could weigh on investment in the mining, oil and gas sector."
Other factors are generally positive for investment spending: corporate bal-
"ance sheets are healthy, and the terms and conditions for financing are very"
"stimulative. In addition, as time passes there will be a natural increase in"
investment to repair and replenish aging capital stock. There is no evidence
"yet, however, of a pickup in firm creation."
Responses to the Bank’s autumn Business Outlook Survey show that the
"balance of opinion on investment intentions has remained relatively high, but"
this is not expected to immediately translate into a large increase in invest-
"ment growth. Although, on balance, firms are planning to invest in machinery"
"and equipment, few are planning significant investments to enhance cap-"
acity in Canada. Analysis by Bank staff suggests that most sectors expected
to lead the recovery in non-energy exports currently have sufficient excess
capacity to meet demand. These sectors include manufacturers of inter-
"mediate metal products, fabricated metals, non-metallic mineral products,"
"as well as other electronic and electrical machinery, equipment and parts. A"
"notable exception is the wood products sector, which is currently operating"
at a capacity utilization rate well above its historical average.

Housing activity shows renewed momentum
Momentum in the housing market has increased since the July Report.
"Housing activity has been more robust than anticipated, buoyed by con-"
tinued very low mortgage rates and exhibiting strength beyond a rebound
from weather-depressed levels earlier in the year.
Housing starts have remained broadly in line with demographic demand in
"recent months (Chart 24). However, sales of existing homes have picked"
"up noticeably since the beginning of the year, to a four-year high (Chart 25)."
"This is contributing to sizable increases in house prices, although the"
national picture continues to mask important regional divergences (Chart 26
"and Chart 27). In general, with historically low price increases and sales"
"volumes, markets in Eastern Canada appear to show signs consistent with"
"a soft landing. This contrasts with major cities in Ontario, Alberta and British"
"Columbia, where housing markets are generally robust and much tighter."

While a good part of the strength can be explained by favourable demo-
"graphics and strong employment gains in parts of the country, it nonetheless"
suggests that household imbalances could increase further.
"Consumer spending has also shown some renewed vigour recently, with car"
sales in particular reaching record highs. The strength in both housing and
consumption has led to an uptick in the growth of household credit.
The Bank continues to expect that the share of residential investment in the
economy will decline to a more sustainable level over the projection period.
The declines in commodity prices and the terms of trade are expected to
weigh on household income and contribute to a modest slowing in house-
"hold spending. Consequently, the savings rate should remain close to recent"
levels. The ratio of household debt to disposable income is expected to
edge higher from its current elevated level before stabilizing by 2016.

a. Numbers in parentheses are from the base-case projection in the July 2014 Monetary Policy Report. Assumptions for the price for crude oil are based on a recent
average of spot prices.
"However, this outlook for housing and the household sector depends on"
"other aspects of the projection, such as a more robust global economy,"
"stronger growth of Canadian exports and investment, and the beginning"
of a normalization of global market interest rates.
The economy must reach full capacity for inflation to be
sustained at 2 per cent
Real GDP growth is projected to average close to 2 1/2 per cent over the
"next year before slowing gradually to around 2 per cent by the end of 2016,"
roughly the estimated growth rate of potential output (Box 3). While the lower
"Canadian dollar will provide some offset, on net, the Bank estimates that the"
weaker profile for the terms of trade in this projection compared with July
will curb GDP growth by approximately 1/4 of a percentage point in 2015
through a combination of weaker spending by households and businesses.
The Bank expects that the economy will gradually return to its full production
capacity in the second half of 2016 (Table 2 and Table 3). Given the degree
"of uncertainty inherent in projections, the Bank judges that GDP growth will"
"likely be within ±0.5 percentage points of the base-case projection in 2015,"
with a somewhat wider range in 2016.

Chart 3-B: The expected pickup in business investment
should contribute to improved labour productivity
"Year-over-year percentage change, quarterly data"
The growth of potential output is projected to remain roughly stable over the
"2014–17 period. While demographic factors, mainly the aging population,"
"result in a moderation in the growth rate of trend labour input, the impact on"
potential growth is projected to be largely offset by a modest improvement
in the growth of trend labour productivity associated with the expected
firming in business investment growth.
Core inflation is expected to remain around 2 per cent over the projection
horizon. The depreciation of the Canadian dollar over the past two years or
so and the effects of sector-specific shocks are expected to continue to put
upward pressure on year-over-year inflation until about mid-2016. Offsetting
"these effects, excess capacity in the economy and the effects of competi-"
tion in the retail sector are anticipated to continue to exert downward
"pressure on core inflation, although at a diminishing rate. It is difficult to be"
precise about the size of the competition effects on the CPI and the timing
"of their dissipation. In the second half of 2016, when the economy is fore-"
"cast to reach and remain at full capacity, inflation is expected to be about"
2 per cent on a sustained basis (Chart 28).

"As discussed earlier, there is considerable uncertainty regarding the degree"
"of slack in the economy, including uncertainty related to the dynamics of the"
"labour gap relative to the output gap (Box 1). Therefore, there is uncertainty"
about how long it will take for the economy to reach full potential and for
"inflation to return sustainably to target. For example, using the lower end of"
"the range for the output gap in the third quarter (-1 1/2 per cent), the Bank"
estimates that core inflation would decline to about 1 1/2 per cent in the
"second half of 2015, or 0.2 percentage points lower than in the base-case"
"projection, assuming no monetary policy response. Inflation would also"
take approximately three quarters longer to return sustainably to target.
"Conversely, a starting-point output gap of -1/2 per cent would push inflation"
about 0.2 percentage points above the base-case projection in 2015.
Total CPI inflation is forecast to remain close to 2 per cent in the near term
"and to decline to about 1 1/2 per cent in mid-2015, mainly in response to the"
recent fall in energy prices. Total CPI inflation is then expected to rise grad-
"ually and to return to target in the second half of 2016. As always, the profile"
"for total CPI inflation can vary importantly, depending on movements in vola-"
"tile energy components. For example, if the base-case scenario assumed"
"that oil prices were 10 per cent higher (lower), total CPI inflation would be"
higher (lower) by 0.3 percentage points over the coming year.
Inflation expectations remain well anchored: the October Consensus
Economics forecast for total CPI inflation was 2.0 per cent in 2014 and
1.9 per cent in 2015. The results of the autumn Business Outlook Survey
suggest that the vast majority of firms still expect inflation over the next
"two years to be within the 1 to 3 per cent range, with the central tendency"
slightly below 2 per cent.8
"8	 As of the summer 2014 Business Outlook Survey, a supplemental question was added to identify the"
probability that each firm assigns to various ranges for inflation. The central tendency is the median
respondent’s implied rate of expected inflation calculated using these probabilities.

"Based on the past dispersion of private sector forecasts, a reasonable range"
around the base-case projection for total CPI inflation is ±0.3 percentage
points.9 This range is intended to convey a sense of forecast uncertainty.

"core inflation and total CPI inflation, respectively, from the fourth quarter of"
2014 to the end of 2016.

Risks to the Inflation Outlook
The outlook for inflation is subject to several risks emanating from both the
external environment and the domestic economy. The Bank judges that the
risks to the projected inflation path are roughly balanced.
The most important risks to inflation are the following:
(i)
Stronger U.S. private demand
Stronger-than-expected private demand in the United States is the
most important upside risk to inflation in Canada. With healthy cor-
"porate balance sheets and good profitability, a rekindling of animal"
spirits could lead businesses to increase hiring and investment by
more than expected. These improvements would boost confidence
"and lead to stronger labour income, supporting household spending"
"and economic activity more generally. More robust U.S. activity, in"
"turn, would generate positive spillovers to growth in the rest of the"
world and to commodity prices. Canadian exports would benefit from
firmer global demand. Higher commodity prices would benefit com-
modity producers and provide a further boost to Canadian private
spending through stronger terms of trade and income.
(ii)	 Further disappointment in global growth
"There is a risk that global economic growth could once again disappoint,"
remaining below potential over 2015–16. There are a number of possible
"triggers for this risk, including the realization of secular stagnation, a"
"housing-induced slowdown and financial stress in China, and a geopolit-"
ical event that impairs global confidence. If any one of these risks were
"to materialize, it would weigh on U.S. and Canadian economic growth"
"through trade, financial and confidence channels, reducing external"
demand for Canadian exports and lowering Canada’s terms of trade.
(iii)	 Lower oil prices
"Global oil prices have fallen sharply since the July Report, reflecting"
concerns about global demand as well as important supply-side
"developments. There is a risk that oil prices could fall further, espe-"
cially if global growth prospects continue to weaken. While lower oil
"prices would benefit consumers, their effect on Canada would, on"
"balance, be negative, reducing Canada’s terms of trade and domestic"
income. Persistently lower-than-assumed oil prices could also have
a material impact on investment and activity in the oil sector and the
associated manufacturing supply chain.

(iv)	 Weaker Canadian exports and business investment
Recent data suggest that a broad-based pickup in exports is under
"way, in line with a continued strengthening of the U.S. economy and"
"the past depreciation of the Canadian dollar. However, for a given"
"global outlook, there remains a risk that exports could disappoint."
Recent Bank analysis suggests that production capacity in a number
of export sectors has declined significantly since 2000 as companies
have closed their facilities in Canada and relocated. Reduced cap-
acity could limit the extent to which non-energy exports continue to
benefit from stronger external demand over the medium term. At the
"same time, business investment growth has yet to mirror the pickup"
in exports. While the Bank continues to expect investment to gain
"momentum as economic uncertainty dissipates, the realization of a"
downside risk to exports would also jeopardize the recovery in invest-
"ment growth. Together, weaker exports and business investment"
would pose a downside risk to inflation.
(v)
Stronger household spending in Canada
Household spending has shown signs of renewed vigour in recent
months. While a soft landing in the housing market remains the most
"likely scenario, near-record-high house prices and debt levels relative"
to income leave households vulnerable to adverse shocks. Continued
strength in housing and consumption would provide a near-term
"boost to economic activity, but would also further exacerbate existing"
imbalances in the household sector and increase the likelihood and
potential severity of a correction later on. A disorderly unwinding of
"these imbalances, should it materialize, could have sizable negative"
effects on other parts of the economy and on inflation.
