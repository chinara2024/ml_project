CANADA’S INFLATION-CONTROL STRATEGY
Inflation control and the economy
• Inflation control is not an end in itself; it is the means whereby monetary
policy contributes to solid economic performance.
• Low inflation allows the economy to function more effectively. This con-
tributes to better economic growth over time and works to moderate
cyclical fluctuations in output and employment.
The monetary policy instrument
• Announcements regarding the Bank’s policy instrument—the target over-
"night interest rate—take place, under normal circumstances, on eight pre-"
specified dates during the year.
"• In setting a target for the overnight rate, the Bank of Canada influences"
short-term interest rates to achieve a rate of monetary expansion consis-
tent with the inflation-control target. The transmission mechanism is com-
plex and involves long and variable lags—the impact on inflation from
changes in policy rates is usually spread over six to eight quarters.
The targets
"• In February 1991, the federal government and the Bank of Canada jointly"
announced a series of targets for reducing total CPI inflation to the mid-
point of a range of 1 to 3 per cent by the end of 1995. That inflation-
"control target range was extended a number of times, most recently"
"in May 2001, in this last case to the end of 2006. Monetary policy"
aims to keep future inflation at the 2 per cent target midpoint of
"this range, both to maximize the likelihood that inflation stays"
within the target range and to increase the predictability of inflation
over the longer term (Crawford 2001).
Monitoring inflation
"• In the short run, a good deal of movement in the CPI is caused by transi-"
tory fluctuations in the prices of such volatile components as fruit and
"gasoline, as well as by changes in indirect taxes. For this reason, the Bank"
focuses on a core measure of CPI inflation that excludes eight of the most
volatile components of the CPI and adjusts the remaining components to
remove the effect of changes in indirect taxes. Core inflation also tends to
be a better indicator of underlying inflationary pressures than the latest
twelve-month rate of increase in the total CPI (Macklem 2001).

MONETARY POLICY REPORT
— April 2006 —
This is a report of the Governing Council of the Bank of Canada:
"David Dodge, Paul Jenkins, Sheryl Kennedy, Pierre Duguay,"
"David Longworth, and Tiff Macklem."
"Global imbalances are a global problem, and"
their resolution requires a global effort . . . .
While the specific policy measures will vary
"from country to country, there are common prin-"
ciples that policy-makers everywhere should fol-
low. These include the adoption of appropriate
"fiscal policies, the promotion of well-functioning"
"labour and product markets, the provision of a"
"well-functioning social safety net, policies that"
allow for an efficient and sound financial sys-
"tem, and a monetary policy focused on low, sta-"
"ble, and predictable inflation . . . . An orderly"
resolution of imbalances is in all of our interests.

1. OVERVIEW
"The Canadian economy continues to grow at a solid pace, con-"
sistent with the Bank’s outlook in the January Monetary Policy
"Report Update. The global economy has been robust, showing a lit-"
tle more momentum than had been anticipated. This has led to
"higher prices for many commodities which, along with strong"
"domestic demand, have supported economic activity in Canada."
"At the same time, global competition and the past appreciation of"
the Canadian dollar continue to pose challenges for a number of
"sectors. All factors considered, the Canadian economy is judged to"
"be operating at, or just above, its production capacity."
High and variable energy prices associated with the strength of glo-
bal demand have kept total CPI inflation above the Bank’s 2 per cent tar-
"get. Core inflation has remained below 2 per cent, owing to persistent"
downward pressure from the prices of imported consumer goods.
"Against this backdrop, the Bank raised its policy interest rate"
by one-quarter of one percentage point on 7 March and again on
"25 April, bringing it to 4.0 per cent."
"Canada’s GDP is projected to grow by 3.1 per cent in 2006, in"
"line with expectations in the January Update, and by 3.0 per cent in"
"2007, slightly stronger than previously expected. Growth in 2008 is"
expected to be 2.9 per cent. The Canadian economy is projected to
operate slightly above its capacity through 2006 and to return to
capacity by the end of 2008.
"Total CPI inflation will continue to be volatile, affected by the"
evolution of energy prices. Based on prices embedded in energy
"futures markets, the Bank projects total CPI inflation (excluding"
any changes in the Goods and Services Tax) to average close to
2 per cent in 2007 and 2008. Upward pressure on inflation from
excess demand in the economy is offset by downward pressure
from the declining prices of many imported consumer goods. Core
inflation is projected to rise to 2 per cent in the second half of this
year and remain there through the end of 2008.
There are both upside and downside risks to the Bank’s projection
"for growth and inflation. In the Bank’s view, these risks are roughly bal-"
anced with a small tilt to the downside later in the projection period.
"In line with the Bank’s outlook for the Canadian economy, some"
modest further increase in the policy interest rate may be required to
keep aggregate supply and demand in balance and inﬂation on target
over the medium term. The Bank will closely monitor evolving
developments in the Canadian economy in light of the cumulative
increase in the policy interest rate since last September.
Developments in the
target for the overnight
rate since the January
Update:
7 March 2006—up 25 basis
points to 3.75 per cent
25 April 2006— up 25 basis
points to 4.00 per cent

2. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN INFLATION
CPI inflation averaged
2.5 per cent between
September and
March . . .
The 12-month rate of increase in the total CPI was somewhat
"higher than the Bank’s 2 per cent inflation-control target, averag-"
ing 2.5 per cent for the period between September 2005 and March
2006. This chiefly reflected considerable increases in energy prices
"at the consumer level. On the other hand, the core rate of inflation"
"averaged 1.7 per cent over the same period, reflecting continued"
downward pressure from import prices.1
Inflation and the 2 per cent target
. . . and continued to show
considerable volatility.
"The inflation rate for the total CPI has been quite volatile, mov-"
ing in a range between 2.0 and 3.4 per cent since the October Mon-
etary
Policy
Report
(Chart
1).
This
was
caused
by
ongoing
fluctuations in gasoline prices and marked increases in consumer
prices for natural gas.
1. The core measure of inﬂation excludes eight of the most volatile components of
the CPI and adjusts the remaining components to remove the effect of changes in
"indirect taxes. The eight components removed are fruit, vegetables, gasoline, fuel oil,"
"natural gas, intercity transportation, tobacco, and mortgage-interest costs."

Core inflation and
other measures of trend
inflation stayed below
2 per cent.
The core rate of inflation has remained very stable in recent
months at about 1.7 per cent. Other measures of the trend rate of
inflation that the Bank follows have also remained below 2 per
cent (Chart 2).
Although the Canadian economy has been operating close to
"its full production capacity since the second quarter of 2004, the"
"prices of many import-intensive goods have continued to fall,"
reflecting declines in the world prices of many manufactured
goods and the past appreciation of the Canadian dollar. This con-
tinued to put downward pressure on core inflation.2 There has
been relatively little evidence that higher energy costs are being
passed more generally to the prices of other goods and services.
Factors at work on inflation
Aggregate demand and adjustments
to global developments
With much higher energy
prices . . .
"In the second half of 2005 and into early 2006, the Canadian"
"economy continued to grow steadily, even as it underwent signifi-"
cant adjustments in response to global developments and associ-
ated changes in relative prices. These developments included
"strong world economic growth, high and volatile energy prices,"
"high price levels for many other commodities, declining prices for"
"2. Over the past year, reductions in the prices of non-auto durable and semi-durable"
goods (both of which have high import content) took 0.3 percentage points off core
inﬂation.

"many manufactured goods, and the appreciation of the Canadian"
dollar.
. . . Canada’s terms of trade
improved considerably in
the second half of 2005.
The surge in world energy prices improved Canada’s terms of
trade (the price of exports relative to the price of imports) consid-
"erably in the second half of 2005. With this improvement, real"
"income rose more rapidly than real output (measured by real GDP),"
"as evidenced by substantial gains in corporate profits, labour"
"income, and government revenues."
Canada’s real GDP grew
as expected . . .
Canada’s real GDP grew at an annual rate of 3 per cent in the
"second half of 2005, as expected at the time of the January Update."
"Consequently, the level of economic activity at the end of last year"
was very close to what had been anticipated. Based on available
"indicators, it appears that real GDP grew by about 3.2 per cent in"
"the first quarter of 2006, driven by many of the same factors that"
were evident through the second half of last year.
. . . with strong gains in
final domestic demand.
Businesses continued to
significantly increase
capital spending . . .
Final domestic demand continued to contribute significantly to
"GDP growth in the second half of 2005, while net exports were lit-"
"tle changed over the period (Chart 3). Businesses, facing competi-"
tive pressures to reduce costs and increase productivity in some
"instances, and capacity constraints in others, undertook further"
sizable increases in capital spending. These increases were sup-
"ported by strong overall profitability, ongoing reductions in the"
"prices of imported machinery and equipment, and favourable"
financing conditions. The growth of household expenditures eased
"somewhat over this period, following a marked increase in the"
first half of 2005.

. . . and there was sub-
stantial growth in exports
and imports.
"With continued strong growth in the global economy, Canada’s"
"exports rose substantially. Indeed, export growth strengthened"
"appreciably in the second half of 2005, owing largely to a recovery"
"in exports of automotive products. At the same time, import"
"growth also picked up, boosted by the considerable growth in"
final domestic demand.
Energy-related capital
spending has risen very
strongly . . .
High global prices for energy commodities and metals helped
to maintain very high levels of profitability in oil and gas extrac-
"tion, mining, and related processing industries during the second"
half of 2005 and into 2006. Production in these industries also
"picked up noticeably in the second half of 2005, having been held"
"back earlier in the year by temporary disruptions. As a result, cap-"
"ital spending has strengthened appreciably, and plans indicate fur-"
ther
strong
gains
in
investment
spending
for
this
year.
Expenditures on pipeline infrastructure are also being markedly
increased. While the economic impact of higher capital spending
by energy-related firms is most apparent in Western energy-
"producing provinces, some activity in other provinces is also"
being generated by related purchases of goods and services.
"In most sectors with a low exposure to foreign competition,"
"such as construction and wholesale and retail trade, profitability"
"remained strong in the second half of 2005. Output rose solidly,"
"bolstered by strong gains in final domestic demand and, in some"
"cases, lower costs for imported products. Employment in these"
sectors has risen appreciably since the middle of last year.
. . . while many manufac-
turing firms continue
to restructure their
operations.
"Over the same period, profitability weakened in many parts of"
the manufacturing sector because of the continuing impact of the
"strong Canadian dollar, higher energy costs, and strong competi-"
"tion from emerging economies (especially China). As a result,"
employment in manufacturing has continued to fall considerably
as many firms restructured their operations. To further improve
"productivity and decrease costs, manufacturers increased capital"
"spending substantially in 2005, and additional investment is"
"expected this year. With these various initiatives, manufacturing"
productivity rose by some 6.5 per cent at an annual rate between
"the second and fourth quarters of 2005. Thus, output continued to"
increase
even
as
employment
in
the
manufacturing
sector
declined.
Estimated pressures on capacity
Most of the indicators of capacity pressures suggest that the
economy was operating at or above its production capacity in the
first quarter of 2006.
"In the Bank’s spring Business Outlook Survey, the percentage of firms"
reporting labour shortages or difficulties meeting an unanticipated
B A N K  O F  C A N A D A
10
"increase in demand remained above average, although there was"
some easing from the preceding survey (Chart 4). The Bank’s con-
ventional measure of the output gap also suggests that the econ-
omy was operating slightly above its potential in early 2006
(Chart 5). Statistics Canada’s measure of capacity utilization in the
"non-farm, goods-producing sector has been indicating considera-"
ble pressure on production capacity for some time.
"Labour market indicators suggest, in general, that the econ-"
omy is operating close to potential. Wage developments and the
recent evidence of a pickup in labour productivity growth are dis-
cussed in the next section of this report.
"In contrast, core inflation seems to be pointing to less pressure"
"on capacity, having stayed below 2 per cent since the end of 2003."
"As noted earlier in this report, however, the downward pressure"
on the core rate has also reflected ongoing reductions in the prices
of many finished manufactured goods partly related to new pro-
duction in Asia. And total CPI inflation has been running above
"2 per cent, largely reflecting tightness in global energy markets"
that is also partly related to the strong economic growth in Asia.
"On balance, the information from consumer prices does not pro-"
vide much evidence of excess supply.
The economy was
"operating at, or just"
"above, its production"
capacity in early 2006.
"Based on a review of all the indicators of capacity pressures, it is the"
judgment of the Governing Council that the Canadian economy was
"operating at, or just above, its production capacity in early 2006."

Wages and productivity
The underlying trend in
wages is running between
3 and 3 3/4 per cent . . .
Growth in aggregate wages picked up in the second half of
"2005 after several years of subdued gains, although it appears that"
the rate of increase eased somewhat in early 2006. A good indica-
tor of the underlying trend in wages is the average hourly wages
of permanent workers reported in the Labour Force Survey. That
measure indicates that the rate of increase in aggregate wages has
ranged between 3 and 3 3/4 per cent since mid-2005 (Chart 6).
Wage increases in oil- and gas-producing provinces continue
to be conspicuously higher than those in other parts of the coun-
"try. This reflects the differing pressures in labour markets, which"
have encouraged workers to move—or commute—to Alberta from
other provinces.
. . . and labour produc-
tivity picked up.
"After a two-year period of essentially no change, labour pro-"
"ductivity growth accelerated in the second half of 2005, with pro-"
ductivity in the fourth quarter up 1 1/2 per cent from a year
earlier (Chart 7). This brought it closer to the Bank’s assumption
for trend labour productivity growth over the longer term of
"about 1 3/4 per cent. At the sectoral level, strong productivity"
growth broadened beyond manufacturing and wholesale trade to
"include transportation and warehousing, information and cultural"
"industries, and accommodation and food services. Together with"
"the recovery in aggregate productivity growth, this evidence of"
broadening is particularly encouraging.

(at annual rates) for the quarter.

The data also show a rise of 5 per cent in hourly labour compensa-
"tion over the past year (Chart 7), and—after productivity gains are taken"
into account—a 3 1/2 per cent rise in unit labour costs in the year ending
"in the fourth quarter of 2005. This result, however, was boosted by unu-"
"sually large one-time payments, such as bonuses and commissions."
Underlying labour compensation gains of 3 to 3 3/4 per cent and pro-
"ductivity growth of 1 1/2 per cent, are consistent with increases in unit"
labour costs close to 2 per cent.

Commodity and output prices and the terms of trade
Natural gas prices have
fallen back markedly
since the fourth quarter
of 2005 . . .
"The price for light crude oil (West Texas Intermediate), which"
"was US$65 per barrel at the time of the January Update, averaged"
US$70 in the ten days ending on 21 April 2006. Prices for Cana-
"dian heavy crude oil, which had been considerably weaker since"
"late 2005, have rebounded markedly so far in April.3 Over the past"
"three months, natural gas prices have fallen to about $7 per"
"MMBtu, considerably below the levels estimated last autumn. This"
chiefly reflects the easing of demand caused by unusually mild
winter weather conditions in North America.
. . . while the prices of
non-energy commodities
have risen further.
The prices of non-energy commodities have risen further in recent
"months (Chart 8). Metals prices, in particular, saw substantial gains, driven"
by the combination of robust global demand and constrained supply.
With the significant improvement in Canada’s terms of trade
"in the second half of 2005 (Chart 9), the chain price index for GDP"
(a broad price measure of the goods and services produced in
Canada) rose 4.1 per cent between the fourth quarter of 2004 and
"the fourth quarter of 2005 (Chart 10). As a result, nominal GDP"
rose by a marked 7.1 per cent over the same period. The strong
growth in real income provided considerable support for the sub-
stantial advance in final domestic demand.
The recent decline in the price of natural gas is expected to
contribute to a modest reduction in early 2006 in Canada’s terms
"of trade and, thus, in the growth of nominal GDP."
3. Heavy crude oil accounts for close to 40 per cent of total Canadian crude oil pro-
duction. The substantial easing (over and above normal seasonal ﬂuctuations) in
prices for Canadian heavy crude oil in late 2005 and early 2006 chieﬂy reﬂected the
"recent expansion of oil sands production, combined with a lack of sufﬁcient pipeline"
and upgrading capacity to convert this additional output of heavy crude oil to
lighter grades. Additional pipeline capacity has been a major factor in the subse-
quent rebound in prices.

3. FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Interest rates and exchange rates
Policy rates in industrial-
ized countries continued
to move higher.
"Over the past six months, policy rates in a number of the"
"industrialized countries have moved higher, against the back-"
ground of continued strength in the global economy (Chart 11).
"The U.S. Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank, and the"
"Bank of Canada have raised their respective policy rates, while the"
Bank of Japan has recently announced the gradual removal of its
policy of quantitative easing. Financial market expectations of
"short-term interest rates have tended to move up since the Update,"
consistent with favourable economic developments.
The removal of liquidity
helped to push up yields
on longer-term bonds.
Higher actual and expected policy rates in most industrial
countries helped push up yields on longer-term bonds (Chart 12).
"Long-term yields had been particularly low, partly because of"
"technical demand factors, as well as the global imbalance between"
desired savings and desired investment. Yields on Canadian
"bonds have also trended upwards since the last Update. However,"
the spread between the yields on U.S. and Canadian bonds has
"widened across all maturities since January, as the yields on U.S."
government bonds of comparable maturities moved up by more.

The Canadian dollar
is relatively firm against
most major currencies.
The Canadian dollar has been relatively firm against most
"major currencies since the January Update, and it has traded in a"
slightly higher and wider range against the U.S. dollar (roughly
85 1/2 to 88 1/2
cents U.S.) than was noted at that time
"(Chart 13). Fundamental factors such as rising commodity prices,"
"particularly prices for energy and metals, have continued to sup-"
"port the Canadian dollar over the period, largely offsetting the"
impact of negative Canada-U.S. interest rate differentials.

Credit conditions and other
financial developments
Favourable credit condi-
tions for businesses and
healthy corporate balance
sheets . . .
. . . augur well for busi-
ness investment.
Credit spreads on corporate bonds have remained low in
"recent months, but because interest rates have been higher on"
"Canadian government bonds, firms generally face modestly higher"
borrowing costs than at the time of the October Report.
"Despite this rise, business credit conditions continue to be very"
"favourable (Chart 14). Supported by record profit margins, corpo-"
"rate balance sheets have continued to improve, with non-financial"
"firms now holding historically high cash balances, particularly"
those in the resource-related sector concentrated in Western Can-
"ada. Reflecting these healthy corporate financial results, the TSX"
has risen strongly. These robust financial conditions augur well for
continued strong investment by businesses.
Strong household borrow-
ing continues to support
consumer spending . . .
The growth in household borrowing has continued to trend
"upwards since the October Report (Chart 15), largely reflecting"
strong activity in the housing market. With home resales and
"housing starts showing renewed vigour, the growth of mortgage"
"credit is accelerating. In addition, rising house prices and financial"
innovation continue to bolster consumer borrowing secured by
"home equity, either through mortgage refinancing or through"
home-equity lines of credit. These home-equity withdrawals have
provided support to recent household spending. Strong credit

growth is expected to continue to support expenditures on hous-
ing and consumption through the first half of 2006.
. . . and growth in narrow
money points to robust
output growth in the first
half of 2006.
"Since the October Report, growth in narrow money (M1+) has"
"picked up, largely owing to stronger business deposits. This"
stronger growth suggests some pickup in real output growth in
"the first half of 2006 (Chart 16). Over the same period, growth of"
"broad money (M2++) has also picked up slightly (Chart 17), which"
is consistent with a modest rise in core inflation through 2006.

4.THE OUTLOOK
This section sets out the base-case projection for the global
"economy through to the end of 2008, followed by the correspond-"
ing base-case projection for the Canadian economy. The base-case
projection has been developed assuming a smooth and orderly
resolution
of
global
imbalances
involving
supportive
policy
actions to rebalance global demand and a gradual real effective
depreciation of the U.S. dollar. Energy prices are assumed to be
consistent with current futures prices. A discussion of the risks to
the base-case projection concludes the section.
International
The global economy
continues to expand at
a robust pace.
"Global output rose 4.7 per cent in 2005, which was somewhat"
"higher than expected, with most major overseas economies partic-"
"ipating in the expansion. After another strong year in 2006,"
growth in the global economy is expected to ease somewhat in
2007 and 2008 as excess capacity becomes more fully utilized.
(See Table 1.) Despite the robust global economic expansion and
"higher energy prices, there are, as yet, few signs of a buildup of"
underlying inflationary pressures at the consumer level. Monetary
authorities in many countries have already taken policy actions to
"promote sustainable, non-inflationary growth."
GDP growth in China has
continued to surprise on
the upside . . .
. . . and growth has picked
up in Japan.
Growth in newly industrialized Asian economies advanced
"rapidly, with GDP growth in the region averaging 9.0 per cent in"
"2005,"
somewhat
stronger
than
anticipated.
China’s
economy
"expanded by 9.9 per cent, boosted mainly by robust investment"
and exports. Revisions to the Chinese national accounts suggest
that growth in the service sector in China has been substantially
"higher than earlier reported. Over the projection horizon, eco-"
nomic growth in China is expected to continue at a strong though
"slightly more moderate pace, with a shift in the composition of"
demand towards private consumption.
Economic growth in Japan has also been stronger and more
broadly based than anticipated in earlier Reports. The Japanese
"economy advanced 2.7 per cent in 2005, led by growth in invest-"
"ment and household spending, although export growth also"
"remains robust. In 2006, economic growth in Japan is expected to"
"strengthen further, driven largely by domestic demand, before eas-"
ing to a rate consistent with the growth of production capacity in
subsequent years.
M O N E T A R Y  P O L I C Y  R E P O R T — A P R I L  2 0 0 6
21
The European Union is
recovering.
Economic growth in the European Union continues to be mod-
"est, although somewhat better than anticipated in the October"
"Report, at 1.5 per cent for 2005. Growth has been supported by rel-"
atively solid exports and investment. Business surveys point to
"further improvement ahead, and accommodative monetary condi-"
tions should continue to support a gradual expansion going forward.
"In the United States, real GDP expanded by 3.5 per cent in 2005,"
with economic activity slowing more than expected towards the
end of the year. Monthly indicators suggest that the economy has
"picked up markedly in early 2006, led primarily by strong domes-"
"tic demand. Partly related to post-hurricane rebuilding, business"
"investment remains supportive of growth in 2006. Overall, infla-"
tionary
pressures
have
remained
relatively
contained
in
the
"United States, despite high and volatile energy prices. The U.S."
"economy is expected to continue to expand strongly in 2006, with"
real GDP growth of 3.5 per cent. Growth is then expected to mod-
erate to 3.2 per cent in 2007 and to 3.1 per cent in 2008. This is
"largely due to a levelling off in the housing market, higher interest"
"rates, and some fiscal consolidation, all of which should contribute"
to a slowing in consumer spending.
Growth in the U.S.
economy is projected to
continue at 3.5 per cent in
2006 before moderating
gradually.
The continued strength in commodity prices since the January
Update has reflected the robust global economy. Futures prices for
crude oil for the remainder of 2006 and through 2007 are higher
"than those in the January Update, while those for natural gas are"
slightly lower (ranging from US$8 to US$11.50 per MMBtu) over
the remainder of this year and largely unchanged for 2007
(Chart 18). The Bank incorporates these futures prices for energy
as the assumptions underlying its base-case projection. Prices for
"non-energy commodities are generally assumed to remain firm,"
consistent with sustained global growth.
The base-case projection
involves a gradual rebal-
ancing of global demand.
The global outlook in this base-case projection involves an
orderly resolution of global imbalances stemming from policies to
"rebalance global demand and market-led adjustments, including a"
gradual real effective depreciation of the U.S. dollar. The rebalanc-
ing is supported by a reduction in the U.S. fiscal deficit and poli-
"cies that support domestic demand growth elsewhere, including"
ongoing structural reform in Europe and Asia. The weaker U.S.
"dollar, combined with a rise in U.S. long-term interest rates, is"
expected to lend support to the rotation in the composition of U.S.
aggregate demand growth away from domestic sources to external
ones.

The exchange rate adjustment envisaged in the base-case pro-
jection involves a depreciation of the U.S. real effective exchange
rate of about 7 per cent by the end of the projection horizon. At
"the same time, the currencies of emerging Asia, Japan, and some"
"of the oil-exporting countries, which did not experience a signifi-"
"cant real appreciation in 2002 to 2004, are expected to appreciate"
the most against the U.S. dollar. It is assumed in the base-case pro-
jection that only a small fraction of this U.S.-dollar depreciation
"will be against the Canadian dollar, and will occur late in the pro-"
jection period.
Aggregate demand and supply in Canada
Growth in final domestic
demand is expected to
remain the key driver of
economic expansion in
Canada through 2008.
This scenario of strong global growth with a gradual rebalanc-
ing of demand is broadly supportive of continued economic
"expansion in Canada, but the primary engine of growth in Canada"
is expected to continue to be growth in final domestic demand
(Table 2).
Business investment
is expected to remain
strong . . .
Increases in business investment are expected to remain strong
over the projection horizon. Factors contributing to further sub-
stantial gains in capital spending this year and next include the
"ongoing global economic expansion, expectations of relatively"
"high levels for commodity prices, continued strong profits overall,"

"very solid balance sheets, and declining prices for imported"
machinery and equipment.
. . . and consumer spend-
ing is projected to rise
solidly.
Consumer spending is expected to rise solidly over the projec-
"tion period, reflecting further substantial gains in real disposable"
"incomes. After considerable increases in recent years, housing"
"investment is expected to rise a little further this year, and is,"
"indeed, somewhat stronger than projected in the January Update."
Investment in housing is then expected to ease slightly through
2007 and 2008.
"Overall, government spending on goods, services, and trans-"
fers is assumed to increase at about the same rate as revenues over
"the projection period. Accordingly, growth in expenditures by all"
levels of government combined is projected to be quite strong in
"2006 and 2007, before easing somewhat in 2008."
Net exports are expected
to exert a small drag on
growth for some time.
Exports are projected to rise further as a result of the contin-
ued global economic expansion and significant additions to the
"production capacity for commodities in Canada. At the same time,"
further increases in investment in machinery and equipment
"should boost imports. Accordingly, net exports are still expected"
"to exert a small drag on overall growth for some time, with the"
effect diminishing over the projection horizon.
GDP growth in Canada
is projected to moderate
from just above 3 per cent
in 2006 to just below
3 per cent in 2008.
The Bank’s base-case projection calls for annual average GDP
"growth to be 3.1 per cent in 2006, 3 per cent in 2007, and 2.9 per"
"cent in 2008 (Chart 19, Table 3). The assumption for potential out-"
put growth is 2.9 per cent in 2006 and 3.0 per cent in 2007 and 2008.
This implies that the economy would be in slight excess demand
"in 2006, before returning to potential output by the end of the pro-"
"jection period. In the base-case projection, the slowing in U.S. eco-"
"nomic growth, combined with the lagged effects of past interest"
"rate increases, as well as some modest further increase in interest"
"rates across the yield curve, will bring aggregate demand and sup-"
ply back into balance.

Inflation
Indicators of near-term
inflation expectations
"have eased back, and"
longer-term measures
continue to be well
anchored to 2 per cent.
"After edging up at the time of the October Report, most indica-"
tors of near-term inflation expectations that the Bank follows have
"eased back recently. As well, key medium- and longer-term meas-"
ures continue to be well anchored to the 2 per cent target. In the
"Bank’s spring Business Outlook Survey, 78 per cent of firms"
"expected total CPI inflation to be within a range of 1 to 3 per cent,"
"on average, over the next two years, and the percentage of"
respondents expecting inflation to be above 3 per cent has
"decreased from the autumn survey. Moreover, the average private"
sector forecast for total CPI inflation in both 2006 and 2007 is just
"under 2 per cent, while consensus forecasts of inflation over the"
longer term continue to be near 2 per cent.
Total CPI inflation is pro-
jected to average about
2.0 per cent in 2007
and 2008.
Total CPI inflation is projected to average about 2.5 per cent in
the first half of 2006 and to average close to 2.0 per cent through
2007 and 2008 (excluding the effect of any changes in the GST).
Movements in the 12-month rate of increase in the total CPI will be
importantly affected by developments in the markets for crude oil
and natural gas (Chart 18). Consumer prices for natural gas are
"projected to decrease substantially over the remainder of 2006, as"
the recent downturn in wholesale prices becomes more fully
"reflected in regulated prices and contracts. Note also that, total CPI"
"inflation may fall temporarily well below 2 per cent in September 2006,"
"since there was a surge in energy prices a year earlier, following dis-"
ruptions to U.S. production from hurricane damage.

This outlook does not
include a cut in the GST.
This outlook for inflation does not take into account the fed-
eral government’s announced intention to cut the Goods and Serv-
icces Tax (GST) this year from 7 per cent to 6 per cent. The Bank
estimates that this one-percentage-point cut in the GST will result
in a direct reduction of about 0.6 per cent in the CPI in the month
of its implementation. This will cause a reduction of 0.6 percent-
age points in the year-over-year rate of change in the CPI for the
12 months following implementation. With inflation expectations
"well anchored, the Bank does not expect second-round effects on"
inflation from the change. (A fuller description of the expected
impact of a GST cut appears in Technical Box 1.)
The core rate of inflation
should return to the 2 per
cent target in the second
half of 2006 and remain
there over the rest of the
projection period.
Core inflation should remain below 2 per cent through the first
"half of 2006, but rise to 2 per cent in the second half of this year,"
"earlier than expected in the January Update, owing to increases in"
electricity prices. Ongoing downward pressure on core inflation
from reductions in the prices of manufactured goods should be
offset by the upward pressure on inflation coming from the econ-
omy operating with slight excess demand. These offsetting factors
"are projected to diminish in tandem over the projection period,"
leaving core inflation at 2 per cent.
Increases in labour compensation are expected to move up
"close to 4 per cent over the projection period. At the same time,"
"with a further modest gain in the growth of labour productivity,"
the projected year-to-year increase in unit labour costs should be
close to 2 per cent.

Changing the GST: Inflation Impact and Monetary Policy Implications
The federal government has announced its intention to cut the Goods and Serv-
"ices Tax (GST) from 7 per cent to 6 per cent in the near future, and to 5 per cent within"
five years. Such reductions would be expected to directly lower the year-over-year
change in the total CPI in the first 12 months after the GST is reduced.
"In setting monetary policy, the Bank’s approach continues to be to look through"
any direct impact on inflation from changes in indirect taxes and to respond only to
"second-round, or spillover, effects on the evolution of wages and prices. With inflation"
"expectations well anchored, the Bank assesses the risks of second-round effects from"
changes in the GST as minimal.
The Bank estimates that the direct effect of a reduction in the GST from 7 per cent
to 6 per cent would be a reduction of about 0.6 percentage points in the year-over-
year increase in the total CPI for a period of one year following its implementation.
This estimate is based on assumptions about the taxable proportion of each CPI com-
ponent derived from data on the tax revenue generated by the GST.1 Among the com-
ponents of the CPI most affected by this change to the GST are services other than
"shelter, as well as semi-durable and durable goods.2 The core CPI should not be"
"affected by any direct effects of changes in the GST since, by definition, it excludes the"
estimated impact of changes in indirect taxes.
It should be pointed out that these estimates capture only the direct effects and
assume that a change in the GST is fully incorporated into consumer prices during the
month in which it comes into effect. The actual incidence of a change in the GST on
"overall prices depends on market conditions, the structure of costs, and the elasticity"
of demand and supply for various goods and services.
1.
The speciﬁc formula for estimating the initial impact of the GST reduction on the CPI is as
follows:

exempt from the GST.

Risks to the base-case projection
There are both upside and downside risks to the Bank’s base-
"case projection. In the main, the Bank judges that the risks are"
"roughly balanced. However, there remains a small risk of a disor-"
"derly correction of global imbalances, which tilts the risks to the"
downside later in the projection period. This risk appears to have
"lower probability than previously judged, given the tentative"
signs of policy adjustments and of rotation in global demand. (See
Technical Box 2.)
The upside risks for economic growth and inflation in Canada
relate largely to the momentum of the global economy and the
associated future path of commodity prices. The global outlook
has surprised on the upside and may continue to be stronger than
"predicted. This risk, together with geopolitical tensions and possi-"
"ble delays in bringing new supplies online, could push commodity"
"prices still higher. For Canada, this would imply stronger export"
"demand and higher prices for our commodity exports, stronger"
"income growth, and upward pressure on the Canadian dollar."
Stronger global growth could also put pressure on global produc-
tion capacity. This could reduce the pace of price declines for
"many tradable manufactured goods, thereby adding upward pres-"
sure to the base-case projection of inflation in Canada.
The
possibility
that
the
U.S.
economy
could
slow
more
abruptly than anticipated represents an important downside risk
for the Canadian economy. This risk could materialize in several
ways. U.S. households could reduce their demand for housing and
motor vehicles and attempt to rebuild savings more quickly than
projected. This would negatively affect Canadian exports. A
weaker U.S. economy could also come about as part of an adjust-
ment to global imbalances that entailed weaker growth in the rest
of the world and an associated decline in commodity prices. This
would have additional negative consequences for Canada. More
"generally, linked to global imbalances is the risk that the real effec-"
tive depreciation of the U.S. dollar may come more against the
"Canadian dollar than assumed, exerting renewed drag on net"
exports and dampening growth in Canada.
There also continues to be uncertainty about the level and
growth of potential output in Canada. There is a possibility that
productivity growth will be higher than assumed in the base-case
"projection, given the productivity-enhancing investments being"
made by firms and changes in work processes to deal with labour
"shortages. At the same time, the large sectoral and regional adjust-"
ments still under way in response to key relative price movements
continue to make assessments about the level of capacity particu-
larly difficult.

Adjustment of Global Savings and
Current Account Imbalances over the Long Term
"The U.S. current account deficit was 6.4 per cent of GDP in 2005, having increased"
fairly steadily from only 1.5 per cent of GDP in 1995. This deficit has been mirrored by
"a similar increase in current account surpluses elsewhere, most notably in emerging"
"Asia, in the oil-exporting countries and, to a lesser extent, in some of the industrial-"
"ized countries, including Japan and Germany. In recent years, the major causes of"
these current account imbalances have been significant differences between domestic
expenditure and domestic output resulting from low private and public savings in the
United States and relatively high private and public savings elsewhere.
Most observers believe that such a large U.S. current account deficit cannot be
"sustained indefinitely, since this would imply sizable increases in the net external lia-"
bility position of the United States and much higher debt-service payments. Histori-
"cally, countries have adjusted to current account deficits by rebuilding their domestic"
"savings through a slowing of domestic demand, which has typically been accompa-"
nied by a weaker currency. Although most observers agree that the United States will
"follow a similar path, and that the adjustment will be long and gradual, risks have"
been identified concerning the extent of the slowing in the U.S. economy and its
"impact on global economic growth. The most likely scenario, which is assumed in the"
"Bank’s base-case projection presented in this report, is one of smooth adjustment."
There are reasons to believe that global imbalances can be resolved in an orderly
"way. To the extent that global imbalances reflect private sector decisions to save, con-"
"sume, and invest, market forces should be able to reduce them to a sustainable level."
Global financial markets have become more complete and therefore more efficient in
"allocating savings across countries, and large financial institutions appear to be ade-"
quately capitalized and not unduly exposed to risk. Governments continue to say that
they will implement the policy measures necessary to support a market-based adjust-
ment that will reduce these imbalances over the medium term and sustain growth.
"Nevertheless, the risk of a disorderly adjustment increases the longer these imbal-"
ances go unresolved. While there are signs that some of the policy actions necessary to
"facilitate an orderly adjustment are being undertaken to varying degrees, further pol-"
icy action would be helpful to anchor market expectations and encourage an orderly
market-driven adjustment. The failure to implement such policies would increase the
"risk of an alternative scenario with disorderly adjustment; that is, one likely involving"
"serious financial market disruptions (i.e., sharp movements in the U.S. exchange rate"
"and interest rates) that spill over to the real economy, partly through weaker con-"
"sumer and investor confidence and, perhaps, through reactive protectionist meas-"
"ures.1 In this scenario, there would be a pronounced decline in world output and"
reduced demand for Canadian-produced goods and services.
1.
Most observers have focused on two adjustment scenarios—orderly and disorderly—for the
"purpose of analyzing two distinct outcomes. It is important to note, however, that intermedi-"
ate adjustment scenarios are possible.
