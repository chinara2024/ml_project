Bank of Canada increases overnight rate
target to 1/2 per cent and re-establishes
normal functioning of the overnight market
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Media Relations
"Ottawa, Ontario"
"June 1, 2010"
The Bank of Canada today announced that it is raising its target for the overnight
rate by one-quarter of one percentage point to 1/2 per cent. The Bank Rate is
"correspondingly raised to 3/4 per cent and the deposit rate is kept at 1/4 per cent,"
thus re-establishing the normal operating band of 50 basis points for the
overnight rate.
The global economic recovery is proceeding but is increasingly uneven across
"countries, with strong momentum in emerging market economies, some"
"consolidation of the recovery in the United States, Japan and other industrialized"
"economies, and the possibility of renewed weakness in Europe. The required"
rebalancing of global growth has not yet materialized.
"In most advanced economies, the recovery remains heavily dependent on"
"monetary and fiscal stimulus. In general, broad forces of household, bank, and"
"sovereign deleveraging will add to the variability, and temper the pace, of global"
growth. Recent tensions in Europe are likely to result in higher borrowing costs
and more rapid tightening of fiscal policy in some countries – an important
"downside risk identified in the April Monetary Policy Report (MPR). Thus far, the"
spillover into Canada from events in Europe has been limited to a modest fall in
commodity prices and some tightening of financial conditions.
Activity in Canada is unfolding largely as expected. The economy grew by a robust
"6.1 per cent in the first quarter, led by housing and consumer spending."
"Employment growth has resumed. Going forward, household spending is"
expected to decelerate to a pace more consistent with income growth. The
anticipated pickup in business investment will be important for a more balanced
recovery.
CPI inflation has been in line with the Bank’s April projections. The outlook for
"inflation reflects the combined influences of strong domestic demand, slowing"
"wage growth, and overall excess supply."

"In this context, the Bank has decided to raise the target for the overnight rate to"
1/2 per cent and to re-establish the normal functioning of the overnight
market.
"This decision still leaves considerable monetary stimulus in place, consistent with"
achieving the 2 per cent inflation target in light of the significant excess supply in
"Canada, the strength of domestic spending, and the uneven global recovery."
"Given the considerable uncertainty surrounding the outlook, any further"
reduction of monetary stimulus would have to be weighed carefully against
domestic and global economic developments.
Information note:
The next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is 20 July 2010.
"A full update of the Bank’s outlook for the economy and inflation, including risks"
"to the projection, will be published in the MPR on 22 July 2010."
