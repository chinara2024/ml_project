CANADA’S INFLATION-CONTROL STRATEGY
Inflation control and the economy
• Inflation control is not an end in itself; it is the means whereby monetary
policy contributes to solid economic performance.
• Low inflation allows the economy to function more effectively. This con-
tributes to better economic growth over time and works to moderate
cyclical fluctuations in output and employment.
The monetary policy instrument
• Announcements regarding the Bank’s policy instrument—the target over-
"night interest rate—take place, under normal circumstances, on eight pre-"
specified dates during the year.
"• In setting a target for the overnight rate, the Bank of Canada influences"
short-term interest rates to achieve a rate of monetary expansion consis-
tent with the inflation-control target. The transmission mechanism is com-
plex and involves long and variable lags—the impact on inflation from
changes in policy rates is usually spread over six to eight quarters.
The targets
"• In February 1991, the federal government and the Bank of Canada jointly"
announced a series of targets for reducing total CPI inflation to the mid-
point of a range of 1 to 3 per cent by the end of 1995. That inflation-
"control target range was extended a number of times, most recently"
"in May 2001, in this last case to the end of 2006. Monetary policy"
aims to keep future inflation at the 2 per cent target midpoint of
"this range, both to maximize the likelihood that inflation stays"
within the target range and to increase the predictability of inflation
over the longer term (Crawford 2001).
Monitoring inflation
"• In the short run, a good deal of movement in the CPI is caused by transi-"
tory fluctuations in the prices of such volatile components as fruit and
"gasoline, as well as by changes in indirect taxes. For this reason, the Bank"
focuses on a core measure of CPI inflation that excludes eight of the most
volatile components of the CPI and adjusts the remaining components to
remove the effect of changes in indirect taxes. Core inflation also tends to
be a better predictor of underlying inflationary pressures than the latest
twelve-month rate of increase in the total CPI (Macklem 2001; Armour
and Laflèche 2006).

MONETARY POLICY REPORT
— October 2006 —
This is a report of the Governing Council of the Bank of Canada:
"David Dodge, Paul Jenkins, Pierre Duguay,"
"David Longworth, and Tiff Macklem."
It is important to remember that when it comes
"to setting monetary policy, the Bank always tries"
to develop a complete picture of the economy.
We do not react unduly to any individual piece
"of information. Rather, we put all the pieces"
together to get to the underlying trends in the
economy.

1. OVERVIEW
The Canadian economy continues to operate just above its full
"production capacity, and the near-term outlook for core inflation"
"has moved slightly higher. However, with the U.S. economy slow-"
"ing more quickly than expected, the base-case projection for Cana-"
dian economic growth has been revised down slightly from that in
the July Monetary Policy Report Update. Lower energy prices have
led to a downward revision of the projection for total consumer
price inflation. They have also contributed to moving the Cana-
dian dollar into a somewhat lower trading range.
Although domestic demand in Canada has continued to grow
"at a robust pace, GDP growth in the second and third quarters of"
"2006 has been slower than expected, largely because of weaker net"
exports. A weaker near-term outlook for the U.S. economy has
curbed the near-term prospects for Canadian exports and growth.
"As well, the Bank has lowered its assumption for potential growth"
"to 2.8 per cent for the 2006–08 period, given recent developments"
"in labour productivity. As a result of these factors, the Bank’s"
base-case projection for Canadian GDP growth has been lowered to
2.8 per cent this year and 2.5 per cent in 2007. But with the U.S.
"economy projected to recover by the end of 2007, growth should"
pick up to 2.8 per cent in 2008. Such a profile implies that the
small amount of excess demand now in the economy will be elim-
inated by the second half of 2007 and that the economy will then
remain roughly in balance through to the end of the projection
period.
With the economy currently in slight excess demand and with
"strong momentum in housing prices, core inflation is expected to"
move slightly above 2 per cent in the coming months. As the econ-
"omy returns to potential and pressures from housing prices ease,"
core inflation should return to 2 per cent by the middle of 2007
and stay there through to the end of 2008.
Total CPI inflation will continue to be affected by the cut in the
Goods and Services Tax (GST) and by developments in energy mar-
"kets. Based on prices embedded in markets for energy futures,"
total inflation will likely average about 1 1/2 per cent through to
"the second quarter of 2007, before returning to the 2 per cent tar-"
get and remaining there through to the end of the projection
period.
The Bank of Canada left the target for the overnight rate
unchanged at 4.25 per cent on 6 September and 17 October. The

17 October 2006.

"current level of the policy rate is judged, at this time, to be consist-"
ent with achieving the inflation target over the medium term.
"As noted in the press release of 6 September, the risks around"
the base-case projection are judged to be a little greater than at the
time of the July Update. The main upside risk relates to the
momentum in household spending and housing prices. The main
downside risk is that the U.S. economy could slow more sharply
"than expected, leading to lower Canadian exports. The Bank"
judges that the upside and downside risks to its inflation projec-
tion are roughly balanced.
"The correction of global imbalances is unfolding in a benign,"
"albeit slow, manner. However, in the absence of further appropri-"
"ate policy actions, there remains a possibility of a disorderly reso-"
"lution of these imbalances. Consequently, the balance of risks for"
global and Canadian growth is tilted slightly to the downside late
in the projection period.

2. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN INFLATION
CPI inflation fell to 2.1 per
cent in August from 2.8 per
cent in May . . .
The 12-month rate of increase in the total CPI fell to 2.1 per
cent in August from 2.8 per cent in May. This drop largely
reflected the impact on consumer prices of the GST reduction in
"July 2006, as well as lower year-to-year increases in energy prices"
at the consumer level. If the effect of changes in indirect taxes is
"excluded, the rate of increase in the total CPI was 2.6 per cent in"
"August.1 The core rate of inflation, which also removes the effects of"
"changes in indirect taxes, moved up to 2.0 per cent in July and August,"
after remaining at about 1.7 per cent over the first four months of this
year.2
Inflation and the 2 per cent target
. . . but the August infla-
tion rate was somewhat
higher than expected.
While the rate of increase for the total CPI moved down close
"to the 2 per cent inflation target in August (Chart 1), it was some-"
what higher than projected in the July Update. There was an
"upward surprise in the price of gasoline. As well, prices in the"
housing and service sectors increased at a slightly higher rate than
1. The combined direct effect of the 1-percentage-point GST reduction and small
increases in other indirect taxes is now estimated to be a decrease of 0.5 per cent
in the total CPI in July and August 2006. The magnitude of the decrease arising
from the effect of changes in indirect taxes is slightly smaller than the previous
"estimate of 0.6 per cent, mainly because of increases in federal excise taxes on"
tobacco products and alcoholic beverages.
2. The core measure of inflation excludes eight of the most volatile components of
the CPI and adjusts the remaining components to remove the effect of changes in
"indirect taxes. The eight volatile components are fruit, vegetables, gasoline, fuel"
"oil, natural gas, intercity transportation, tobacco, and mortgage-interest costs."

"expected. For instance, homeowners’ replacement costs (an impor-"
tant component of core prices for shelter) have risen at a faster
pace this year as a result of considerably higher prices for new
"housing, particularly in Alberta. Prices for other services have also"
"increased at a slightly faster rate, mainly because of a modest"
rebound in automobile insurance premiums. Partially offsetting
these upward pressures has been the decrease in the prices of
"many import-intensive goods, which reflects the effects of further"
declines in the world prices of many manufactured goods and the
past appreciation of the Canadian dollar.
Core inflation moved up
to 2 per cent in July
and August.
The core rate of inflation moved up to 2.0 per cent in July—
earlier than expected—and remained there in August. Other meas-
ures of the trend rate of inflation that the Bank monitors have also
"tended to edge up close to 2 per cent, if the effects of changes in"
indirect taxes are excluded (Chart 2).3 These increases in trend
inflation measures are consistent with the Bank’s view that the
economy has recently been operating just above its production
capacity.

Factors at work on inflation
Aggregate demand
Real GDP growth was
weaker than expected in
the second quarter.
"Canadian real GDP, after growing at an annual rate of 3.6 per"
"cent in the first quarter of 2006, rose by only 2.0 per cent in the"
"second quarter, less than the 3.2 per cent projected in the July"
Update. Currently available information suggests that real GDP
grew by about 2 per cent in the third quarter of 2006. This is also
less than previously anticipated and reflects evidence suggesting
considerably weaker inventory accumulation by businesses than
in the second quarter.
There were strong gains in
final domestic demand in
the first half of 2006 . . .
Final domestic demand continued to be the major contributor
"to GDP growth in the first half of 2006, while net exports decreased"
over the period (Chart 3). Strong overall profitability and capacity
"pressures in a number of industries, combined with ongoing"
reductions in the prices of imported machinery and equipment
"and favourable financing conditions, supported marked increases"
in
capital
spending
by
businesses.
With
further
substantial
increases in real personal disposable income and household net
"worth (partly reflecting a considerable rise in housing prices), the"
growth of household expenditures was also quite robust over this
"period, picking up from the pace seen in the second half of 2005."
". . . but exports fell back,"
despite ongoing strength in
the global economy.
"Despite ongoing strength in the global economy, there was a"
"broad-based decline in Canada’s exports in the first half of 2006,"
which appears to be related to several factors (Technical Box 1).
Exports of automotive products returned to more normal levels
after being unusually high towards the end of 2005. Exports of

Interpreting the Recent Behaviour of Exports
"After experiencing vigorous growth during the second half of 2005, exports of"
Canadian goods and services fell in the first half of this year. This pattern is not well
"explained by standard macro export equations used by the Bank. Rather, it appears to"
"be more related to specific factors, particularly developments in the automotive sector."
The expansion of the U.S. economy has been a positive factor for Canadian exports
"over the past several years, while the appreciation of the Canadian dollar has had a"
"dampening effect. According to an estimated error-correction model,1 the negative"
"impact of the exchange rate moderated somewhat during the first half of 2006, and thus"
"does not explain the slowdown in exports. Indeed, the model underpredicted growth"
"during the second half of 2005, while overestimating it more recently. Thus, many of the"
recent movements in exports seem to be attributable to shocks that are not captured by
this model.
An examination of the sectoral composition of exports suggests that developments
in the automotive sector can explain in large part the difference between actual data and
the model simulations. Exports in this sector experienced very strong growth during the
second half of 2005. Canadian automobile exports relative to U.S. sales reached excep-
"tional highs at the end of the year. During the first half of 2006, exports in this sector"
"declined, and their relationship to U.S. sales started to return to more normal levels."
Two further factors contributed to the strength of exports during the second half of
2005: the reopening of the U.S. border to live cattle from Canada and increased exports
"of lumber in anticipation of post-hurricane reconstruction. Conversely, during the sec-"
"ond quarter of 2006, exports of machinery and equipment posted a sharp drop that the"
model did not predict.
"For the second half of 2006, the model predicts robust export growth. According to"
"the model, the dampening effect of the exchange rate will continue to abate, while the"
"boost provided by expanding demand in the United States will diminish somewhat,"
"reflecting in part the slowdown in the U.S. housing sector. Nonetheless, in the base-case"
"projection presented in this Report, exports grow more slowly than the 6 per cent pre-"
"dicted by the model, largely because of further adjustments in the automotive sector."
1. This econometric model links the rate of growth in exports to movements in the principal components
"of U.S. demand, a measure of relative prices, and a measure of openness to foreign trade. It should be"
noted that the current version of the model differs slightly from that presented in Box 1 of the article
"“Exports, Imports, and the Appreciation of the Canadian Dollar,” in the autumn 2005 issue of the Bank of"
"Canada Review. In the current version of the model, residential construction has been added as a compo-"
nent of U.S. demand.

machinery and equipment also fell sharply in the second quarter of
"2006. As well, the appreciation of the Canadian dollar over the"
past four years continued to restrain growth in the demand for
"Canadian exports. There are, however, indications that export"
"growth revived in the third quarter of 2006, suggesting that some"
of the weakness in the first half of the year reflected transitory fac-
"tors. With ongoing firm growth in final domestic demand, imports"
"continued to rise markedly in the first half of 2006, although at a"
slower pace than was observed in the second half of last year.
Estimated pressures on capacity
Most capacity indicators
suggest an economy in
slight excess demand.
Although there has been some moderation of growth in recent
"months, most indicators of capacity pressures suggest that the"
economy was operating slightly above its production capacity in
the third quarter of 2006.
"With observed weakness in labour productivity growth, the"
Bank’s conventional measure of potential output for the period
since the beginning of 2005 was revised down slightly from the
"estimate used in the last Update.4 At the same time, the weaker"
"economic growth in the second quarter of 2006, combined with"
projected growth of 2 per cent in the third quarter (compared with
"a projection of 3 per cent in the July Update), implies that the level"
of activity in the third quarter was also somewhat lower than
expected. These developments are reflected in the Bank’s conven-
"tional measure of the output gap, which indicates that the econ-"
omy was operating about 0.2 per cent above its production
capacity in the third quarter of 2006 (Chart 4). This estimate is
"subject to a considerable degree of uncertainty, but the broad pic-"
ture of an economy in slight excess demand is consistent with a
range of other capacity indicators.
"In the Bank’s autumn Business Outlook Survey, the percentage"
of firms reporting difficulties in meeting an unanticipated increase
in demand remained above average (Chart 5). Statistics Canada’s
"measure of capacity utilization in the non-farm, goods-producing"
sector also indicated above-average pressure on production capac-
ity in the second quarter of 2006.
The employment-to-population ratio in September remains
"very high by historical standards, while the unemployment rate"
has stayed low. The underlying trend increase in wages seems to
have risen further in recent months and now appears to be more
4. Potential output is now estimated to have increased at an annual rate of
"2.7 per cent in 2005 and 2.8 per cent for the ﬁrst half of 2006, compared with"
respective rises of 2.8 per cent and 2.9 per cent assumed in the last Update. The
Bank’s assessment of the underlying trend in labour productivity growth
"going forward has also been revised down, as discussed in the next section."

consistent with the indicators of tightness in labour markets than
was previously the case.
"Core inflation has been close to 2 per cent since May, despite"
ongoing downward pressure on the prices of globally traded
durable and semi-durable goods. This appears to be consistent

with an economy that has been operating slightly above its pro-
duction capacity.
"Within these national measures, it is evident that capacity"
pressures continue to be strongest in the western provinces. There
has been a marked pickup in housing price increases in Alberta
"and Vancouver and, at the same time, some moderation in price"
gains for housing in certain urban centres in Central and Atlantic
Canada. Wage increases in Alberta also continue to be markedly
"higher than those in other parts of the country, reflecting the dif-"
fering pressures in labour markets. The Bank’s autumn Business
Outlook Survey confirms that capacity pressures remain much more
"intense in the western provinces than elsewhere, with little change"
from the preceding survey.
The economy was operat-
ing just above its
production capacity in
the third quarter of 2006.
"After a review of all the indicators of capacity pressures, it is"
"the judgment of the Governing Council that overall, the economy"
was operating just above its production capacity in the third quar-
ter of 2006.
Labour compensation and productivity
Wage increases have
moved up to between
3 1/2 and 4 per cent in
recent months.
The trend growth in wages has continued to move higher in
"recent months and, as already noted, is now more consistent with"
other indicators of the degree of tightness in labour markets. This
assessment is based on the 12-month change in average hourly
earnings of permanent workers reported by Statistics Canada in
"the Labour Force Survey, which is considered to be a good indicator of"
the underlying change in wages. This measure suggests that the

rate of increase in aggregate wages has risen to between 3 1/2 and
4 per cent (Chart 6). The year-to-year increase in another indicator
of compensation—hourly labour compensation from Statistics
Canada’s
Productivity
Accounts—which
earlier
on
had
been
"boosted by unusually large one-time payments, was also about"
4 per cent in the second quarter of 2006 (Chart 7).
Labour productivity
growth has been averaging
below the assumed trend
growth of 1 3/4 per cent . . .
. . . leading the Bank
to revise down its
assumption for trend
labour productivity
growth to 1 1/2 per cent.
"Over the past three and a half years, productivity growth in"
the business sector has averaged 1.0 per cent. After little change in
"2003 and 2004, productivity picked up considerably in 2005, grow-"
"ing by 2.4 per cent.5 However, productivity growth appears to"
have slowed once again in the first half of 2006. In the absence of a
sustained period with productivity growth above 2 per cent to off-
"set the virtual absence of productivity growth in 2003 and 2004,"
the balance of risks around the Bank’s previous assumption for
trend productivity growth of about 1 3/4 per cent has shifted to
the downside.
"While assessments of trend productivity growth are difficult,"
the modest realized pace of productivity growth is consistent with
an economy that is undergoing significant structural adjustment in
"the face of large movements in commodity prices, the marked"
"appreciation of the Canadian dollar, and new sources of competi-"
tion from emerging Asia. As discussed in previous Monetary Policy
"Reports, this adjustment involves a reallocation of labour and capi-"
tal towards the production of commodities with significantly
"higher prices, and towards the non-tradable goods and services"
"sectors.6 During the adjustment period, capital and labour are"
likely to be less productive. Observed trends in productivity
growth suggest that this adjustment is ongoing and may be hav-
ing a larger and more protracted impact on productivity growth
"than previously projected. With this in mind, something closer to"
1 1/2 per cent would appear to be a more balanced assumption for
trend productivity growth over the next couple of years. With the
assumption regarding trend labour input growth remaining at about
"1 1/4 per cent, this implies potential growth of about 2.8 per cent."
When the modest observed productivity gains are taken into
"account, unit labour costs in the second quarter of 2006 were up"
2.6 per cent from their level a year earlier. With recent compensation
increases at between 3.5 and 4 per cent and with trend productiv-
"ity growth now assumed to be about 1 1/2 per cent, underlying"
5. The year-to-year increase in productivity in the fourth quarter of 2005 had
originally been estimated by Statistics Canada to be 1.5 per cent. This estimate
"has been revised upwards to 2.2 per cent, chieﬂy as a result of corrections to"
the estimates of hours worked in 2005.

increases in unit labour costs have risen but still appear to be in
the range of 2 per cent.
Commodity and output prices and the terms of trade
The prices of non-energy
commodities have
"remained firm, overall,"
since early July . . .
The prices of non-energy commodities have remained firm
since the July Update (Chart 8). Metals prices have risen a little
"further, reflecting strengthening global demand and further pro-"
"duction disruptions. Lumber prices, in contrast, have eased as a"
result of the downturn in the U.S. housing market.
. . . while the prices of
crude oil and natural gas
have fallen back.
"The price of light crude oil (West Texas Intermediate), which"
"was US$74 per barrel at the time of the July Update, averaged"
US$59 in the ten days ending on 13 October 2006. This decrease
appears to reflect market expectations of a reduced supply risk
and some easing in the prospects for global oil demand (resulting
"from the effect of persistently high oil prices). In recent weeks,"
"natural gas prices were also somewhat lower than in early July,"
reflecting
relatively
high
inventories
following
lower-than-
expected demand for cooling in the late summer.
With the marked reduction in natural gas prices since the end
"of 2005, Canada’s terms of trade fell back in the first half of 2006"
"(Chart 9). As a result, the four-quarter change in the chain price"
index for GDP (a broad price measure of the goods and services
produced in Canada) decreased from 4.1 per cent in the fourth
quarter of 2005 to 2.8 per cent in the second quarter of 2006

"(Chart 10). Consequently, the year-to-year increase in nominal GDP"
"moderated during this period, although still rising by some 5.7 per"
cent in the year ending in the second quarter of 2006. The result-
ing above-average increase in real income (defined as the differ-
ence between the year-to-year rise of nominal GNP and that of the
deflator for final domestic demand) was still providing support
for the considerable gain in final domestic demand.7
The recent decline in the prices of crude oil and natural gas
will likely lead to a further reduction in Canada’s terms of trade
"over the remainder of 2006 and, therefore, to slower growth in"
"nominal GDP. In turn, this reduced rate of nominal income growth"
can be expected to put some downward pressure on the growth of
corporate profits and government revenues.

"in explaining changes in real incomes in Canada, see Duguay (2006)."

3. FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Interest rates and exchange rates
Policy rates in industrial-
ized countries outside
North America continued
to move up . . .
. . . but in both Canada
"and the United States,"
policy rates have recently
been left unchanged.
"Since the July Update, policy interest rates have continued to"
move higher in a number of industrialized countries outside
"North America. The European Central Bank, the Bank of England,"
and the Reserve Bank of Australia have all raised their respective
"policy rates, and financial markets expect further policy tightening"
in 2006 and early 2007 (Chart 11). The Bank of Japan has also
"raised its policy rate, effectively ending its “zero interest rate pol-"
"icy,” now that the Japanese economy appears to be on a sustaina-"
"ble growth path. In contrast, policy rates in both Canada and the"
"United States have recently been left unchanged, following a"
number of consecutive increases. Short-term interest rates embody
expectations that policy rates in these two countries will remain at
their current levels for the rest of 2006 but decline somewhat
in 2007.
Yields on long-term bonds
have decreased.
Despite some heightened inflationary concerns among market
"participants at the time of the last Update, inflation expectations in"
major
industrialized
countries
have
since
"moderated,"
partly
reflecting the recent decline in energy prices and the weaker
growth outlook for the U.S. economy. Such developments have

contributed to the decrease in the yields on the long-term government
bonds of major industrialized countries since mid-year (Chart 12).
The Canadian dollar has
traded in a somewhat
lower range than assumed
in the July Update.
Currency markets have been relatively steady since the July
"Update, with many currency pairs trading in relatively narrow"
"ranges. Over this period, the Canadian dollar has generally been"
"within a range of 87.5 to 90.5 cents U.S., compared with the range"
of 88.5 to 91.5 cents U.S. for May to mid-July assumed in the pro-
jection in the Update. It would appear that the impact on the Cana-
dian dollar from the decline in energy prices since July has been
partly offset by an increase in currency flows related to cross-border
"mergers and acquisitions in Canada. Since the end of 2005, the"
Canadian dollar has also traded within a fairly steady range
against the currencies of its other major trading partners (Chart 13
and Technical Box 2).

A New Exchange Rate Index for the Canadian Dollar1
The Bank has developed a new Canadian-dollar effective exchange rate index
"(CERI), to replace its C-6 index.2 This new index better reflects the profile of Canada’s"
"international trade, including the increased importance of China and Mexico."
The CERI offers a major advantage over the C-6 index. It is calculated using a
"weighted average of multilateral trade weights, while the C-6 index uses simple bilat-"
"eral trade weights. Unlike bilateral trade weights, multilateral weights account for third-"
"market competition which, when added to information from bilateral trade numbers,"
gives a more accurate picture of the importance of a particular country in Canada’s
international trade. Third-market export weights capture the competition between two
countries (domestic and foreign country) in all other markets. They are calculated by
multiplying the foreign country’s share of total supply in each third market by the rela-
tive importance of the third markets as destinations for the domestic country’s exports.
"The CERI also uses a broader measure of trade, which includes services trade, and is"
not restricted to industrialized countries. The Bank has taken the opportunity of moving
to a new index to use more recent data in calculating the trade weights.
"In choosing the currencies to be included in the new index, the Bank decided to use"
the currencies of countries with trade weights of 2 per cent or higher based on trade
"data for 1999–2001. From a set of 184 countries, five countries plus the euro zone satisfy"
this criterion. These six jurisdictions account for 86 per cent of Canadian trade based on
the 1999–2001 data. The following table gives the weights for the currencies in the CERI.
1.
An article describing the CERI in more detail can be found on the Bank’s website at
<www.bankofcanada.ca/en/rates/ceri.html>. It will also be in the forthcoming autumn issue of
the Bank of Canada Review.
2.
See <www.bankofcanada.ca/en/rates/mci2.html> for the deﬁnition of the C-6 index. Use of
the C-6 index will be discontinued at the end of 2006.

Credit conditions and other financial developments
Business credit conditions
remain very favourable . . .
Access to credit for the non-financial business sector has
"remained very favourable, at a cost comparable to, or in the case"
"of debt financing, more favourable than that at the time of the"
April Report. Although strong cash flow has moderated firms’ bor-
"rowing requirements, business credit has continued to grow at a"
rate above its historical average because of a marked increase in
capital expenditures.
. . . owing to the health
of the financial and
non-financial business
sectors.
Favourable credit conditions have been supported by above-
average profit margins and the generally sound balance sheets of
"the non-financial business sector. There is, however, growing dis-"
"parity in the profitability of various sectors, with resource-produc-"
ing
and
domestically
oriented
sectors
outperforming
non-
resource-based sectors exposed to trade.
"Financial institutions continue to be in a good position to lend,"
"as a result of their strong profitability, healthy balance sheets, and"
the low level of impaired loans. Financial markets also continue to
have a healthy appetite for the security offerings of Canadian cor-
porations. With Canada’s economic outlook boding well for the
"business sector’s profitability, firms should continue to have ready"
access to the funding needed for robust investment.

Marked gains in house
prices have allowed
households to continue
to finance additional
spending through secured
borrowing.
Financial conditions also continue to provide strong support to
household spending. Increases in house prices and household
credit continue to be well above historical averages (Chart 14).
This is allowing households to finance consumption with loans
secured by home equity. This phenomenon is more pronounced in
"Western Canada, where house prices have risen dramatically over"
"the past two years. Despite this strong credit growth, the debt-"
"service burden of households continues to be modest, since rates"
on mortgages and consumer loans remain historically low.8 These
conditions continue to point to a strong underpinning for contin-
ued growth in household spending.
"Since the last Report, growth in narrow money (M1+) has"
"remained stable, driven by sustained strength in non-personal"
deposits resulting from firms’ accumulation of cash balances. Nar-
row money growth suggests that near-term output growth will be
slightly below the growth of production capacity (Chart 15).
8. The Bank has begun to examine the distribution of debt-service ratios
"across households. From a macro point of view, changes in this distribution"
"over the past six years have been relatively small. In particular, there has been"
no signiﬁcant increase in the percentage of households with high debt-service
ratios. This December’s Financial System Review will discuss this distribution
from a ﬁnancial stability perspective.

4. THE OUTLOOK
This section outlines the Bank’s outlook for the global econ-
"omy through to the end of 2008, followed by the associated projec-"
tion for the Canadian economy. This base-case projection has been
developed assuming a slow and orderly resolution of global
imbalances resulting from supportive policy actions to rebalance
global demand and a gradual real effective depreciation of the
U.S. dollar. Energy prices are assumed to evolve along a path that
"is consistent with current futures prices, and the Canadian dollar"
is assumed to remain within the recent range of 87.5 to 90.5 cents
U.S. The section concludes with a discussion of the risks to the
base-case projection.
International background
The global economy
continues to expand at
a solid pace . . .
. . . but growth in the U.S.
economy has moderated.
"The robust global expansion, under way for the past four"
"years, is expected to moderate only slightly over the next two"
"years. Overall, real global GDP is projected to grow solidly: by"
"5.1 per cent in 2006, 4.7 per cent in 2007, and 4.5 per cent in 2008"
(Table 1). Economic growth in emerging markets has been particu-
"larly strong, with many countries benefiting from earlier increases"
in export earnings stemming from high commodity prices and
from the continued expansion of domestic demand. The growth of
"the U.S. economy, which has been an important source of global"
"demand in recent years, has moderated. The gradual slowing in"
overall global growth through the projection period reflects grow-
ing capacity constraints and the associated tightening in monetary
policy by the major industrial economies.
GDP growth in China
continues to surprise
on the upside.
"Growth in Asia (excluding Japan) continues at a robust pace,"
with China’s vigorous economy still boosting regional growth
rates. The outlook for real GDP growth in China and emerging
"Asia remains buoyant, with only a moderate slowing over the next"
"two years. In Japan, solid growth in investment, and to a lesser"
"extent, in consumer expenditures, is expected to underpin eco-"
nomic activity over the next few years through what is likely to be
"an extended period of fiscal consolidation. In the euro zone, out-"
"put continues to grow, although the pace of expansion will be lim-"
ited by the modest growth in productive capacity.

25
Slower near-term U.S.
growth . . .
"In the United States, real GDP is expected to grow 3.3 per cent"
"in 2006, slightly lower than projected in the July Update. In recent"
"months, there has been a pronounced slowdown in the housing"
"sector, as well as weakness in the motor vehicle sector. The slow-"
ing evident in the second quarter is projected to continue through
"the second half of this year, with GDP growth likely to be in the"
range of 2 to 2 1/2 per cent at annual rates—below the level of
"potential growth of the economy, which is now estimated at about"
3.0 per cent.9
. . . should reduce
inflationary pressures
in the United States.
The base-case scenario projects that U.S. real GDP growth will
remain below potential output growth into 2007 before moving
above potential through 2008. This implies that a small degree of
excess supply would build in the United States before being grad-
ually absorbed in 2008. With excess supply opening up in the U.S.
"economy, core inflation should move gradually lower."

9. Historical revisions to U.S. data from the ﬁrst quarter of 2003 to the ﬁrst
quarter of 2006 indicate that real GDP growth over the period was weaker than
earlier reported. Since much of the downward revision reﬂects lower invest-
"ment growth, our base-case projection now includes less capital deepening"
and thus lower growth in U.S. potential output than previously estimated.

U.S. growth is projected
to recover in 2008.
Domestic demand growth in the United States is expected to
"continue to slow into 2007, owing largely to a downturn in house-"
"hold spending on interest-sensitive goods, such as housing, motor"
"vehicles, and other durables. At the same time, the low cost of cor-"
porate financing and strong growth in corporate profits are
expected
to
continue
to
support
investment.
The
projected
strengthening of GDP growth in 2008 stems largely from two fac-
"tors. First, the housing and auto sectors are expected to stop sub-"
tracting
from
growth.
"Second,"
with
a
further
assumed
real
effective depreciation of the U.S. dollar of about 7 per cent over
"the projection horizon, and a strengthening in global investment"
"which raises demand for U.S. capital goods, the growth in U.S."
exports is projected to accelerate. This strengthening in export
growth would contribute to a gradual improvement in the U.S.
current account deficit.
There are signs of a
rotation in global
demand.
"More broadly, with domestic demand expected to grow more"
slowly in the United States but more quickly in the rest of the
"world, demand is expected to be better balanced around the globe."
"In the base-case scenario, this rotation of demand is supported by"
the assumed depreciation of the U.S.-dollar real effective exchange
"rate, which is expected to occur mainly against the currencies of"
"emerging Asia, Japan, and some of the oil-exporting countries that"
did not experience a significant appreciation in the 2002–04 period.
These developments are consistent with an orderly resolution of
global imbalances.
Futures prices for energy
are much lower than
in July.
Futures prices for crude oil and natural gas over the projection
period are lower than those in the July Update (Chart 16). In the
"case of crude oil, this implies that prices would move up from"
their current level of just under US$60 per barrel to US$65 per bar-
rel by the middle of 2007 and rise gradually to US$67 in 2008.
Base metals prices should
remain relatively high.
The price index for non-energy commodities is expected to
decline over the projection period from the high levels reached in
the third quarter of 2006. This partly reflects anticipated reduc-
tions in metals prices as increases in global capacity come on
"stream. With the weakness in U.S. housing activity, lumber prices"
"are likely to remain low. Even so, with global demand for com-"
"modities projected to remain relatively strong, in line with robust"
"global growth, the overall level of non-energy commodity prices is"
projected to stay high in relation to historical norms.

"In Canada, growth in final domestic demand is expected to"
continue to contribute importantly to economic expansion in the
second half of 2006 and through 2007 and 2008.
Consumer spending is expected to grow at a robust pace over
the projection period as a result of further gains in real disposable
income and increases in household net worth. Housing invest-
"ment, after another substantial gain in 2006, is projected to decline"
slightly in 2007 and 2008.
Business investment is projected to grow strongly. Factors sup-
"porting a strong expansion include current capacity constraints,"
"expectations of ongoing growth in the global economy, indications"
that energy and metals prices will stay relatively high for some
"time, continued favourable financial conditions, strong profit lev-"
"els overall and very solid balance sheets, and further reductions in"
the prices of imported machinery and equipment.
The base-case projection assumes that the government sector
will run a balanced budget over the projection period. Consistent
"with slowing nominal GDP growth, growth in government reve-"
nues is expected to slow. The large surpluses that have been evi-
dent recently would imply that projected growth in spending by
all levels of government will be above projected revenue growth
for a period of time.

Net exports are projected
to exert a drag on growth
through 2007.
With the expected slowing in the growth of U.S. domestic
demand into 2007 and the lagged effects from the past apprecia-
"tion of the Canadian dollar, export growth is projected to be weak"
"over the projection period. At the same time, continued substan-"
"tial increases in investment in machinery and equipment, com-"
bined with the further impact of the past rise of the Canadian
"dollar, should help to boost imports. As a result, net exports"
"should exert a significant drag on overall growth in 2006 and 2007,"
although this effect should ease over the projection period.
Canada’s GDP is
projected to grow
"by 2.8 per cent in 2006,"
"2.5 per cent in 2007,"
and 2.8 per cent
in 2008.
"The Bank’s base-case outlook calls for economic growth, on an"
"average annual basis, to be 2.8 per cent in 2006, 2.5 per cent in"
"2007, and 2.8 per cent in 2008 (Table 2, Chart 17). The outlook for"
both 2006 and 2007 is lower than that in the July Update. This
"lower growth mainly reflects two factors. First, the weaker U.S."
"economic outlook means that the projection for net exports and, to"
"a lesser extent, investment has been revised down. Second, since"
the recent trend in labour productivity has been lower than
"expected (as discussed in section 2), the assumption for growth in"
production capacity from 2006 to 2008 has been revised down to
2.8 per cent.
This profile for GDP growth implies that the economy would
"stay in slight excess demand over the near term, before moving"
back to its production capacity in the second half of 2007. The
economy would then continue to operate at about full capacity
"through to the end of 2008. In this base-case projection, it is the"
near-term slowing and the subsequent pickup in the U.S. econ-
"omy, combined with the lagged effects of past interest rate and"
exchange
rate
"movements,"
that
bring
aggregate
supply
and
"demand back into balance and keep them there. Hence, in this"
"projection, the current level of the policy rate is consistent with"
achieving the 2 per cent inflation target.

The outlook for inflation
Most indicators of
inflation expectations
remained stable over the
past six months.
Most indicators of inflation expectations that the Bank follows
"have remained quite stable since the time of the April Report, and"
key medium- and longer-term measures continue to be close to
"2 per cent. In the Bank’s autumn Business Outlook Survey, 78 per"
cent of firms expected CPI inflation to be within a range of 1 to
"3 per cent, on average, over the next two years. This percentage of"
respondents was almost the same as in the previous three surveys.
"Furthermore, the average private sector forecast for total CPI infla-"
"tion in 2007 was just under 2 per cent, and consensus forecasts of"
inflation over the longer term remained very close to 2 per cent.
Broad money (M2++) growth has risen to around 7 per cent
"(Chart 18), a rate which, if maintained, would be consistent with"
core inflation at about 2 per cent over the next year.
Total CPI inflation is pro-
jected to average close to
2 per cent after mid-2007.
The outlook for the 12-month rate of increase in the total CPI is
importantly affected by the cut in the GST from 7 per cent to 6 per
"cent that took effect on 1 July 2006, and by developments in the"
"markets for crude oil, gasoline, and natural gas (Chart 16). Available"
indicators suggest that total CPI inflation fell below 1 per cent in
September 2006 as a result of the recent decline in crude oil and gaso-
line prices and the base-year effects stemming from the hurricane-
related surge in energy prices in September of 2005. The prices of
both crude oil and natural gas are assumed to follow the path
"given by futures prices, which are below the levels in the July"
"Update. As a result, total CPI inflation is now expected to average"
close to 1.5 per cent from the fourth quarter of 2006 to the second
"quarter of 2007, a little lower than projected in the Update (Table 3)."

"After the direct effect of the GST cut disappears in mid-2007, total"
CPI inflation is expected to average close to the 2 per cent target
over the remainder of the projection period.
Core inflation is expected
to move slightly above
2 per cent before return-
ing to 2 per cent in the
second half of 2007.
The core rate of inflation is expected to move slightly above
"2 per cent through to mid-2007, given the small amount of excess"
demand currently in the economy and continued momentum in
the price of housing. These sources of upward pressure should
continue to be partly offset by further downward pressure arising
"from ongoing decreases in the prices of manufactured goods,"
although these price decreases are expected to moderate over time.
As the economy returns to its production potential and housing pres-
"sures ease, core inflation is projected to move back to 2 per cent by"
the second half of 2007 and remain there.
Increases in labour compensation are expected to average
about 4 per cent over the early part of the projection period before
easing somewhat. Given the assumed growth of trend labour pro-
"ductivity of 1.5 per cent, the expected year-to-year increase in unit"
labour costs is projected to be slightly above 2 per cent in the early
"part of the projection period, declining to 2 per cent by the end of"
the period.

Risks to the outlook
The risks around the
projection are judged to
be somewhat greater than
in July.
The Bank’s base-case projection continues to be subject to
important upside and downside risks. As noted in the press
"release of 6 September, these risks are judged to be somewhat"
greater than at the time of the July Update.
The main upside risk
relates to the momentum
in household spending
and housing prices.
The main upside risk to the Canadian economy continues to
relate to the momentum in household spending and housing
prices. This momentum is linked to strong consumer credit
growth. By increasing home equity and thus expanding the availa-
"bility of collateral, the recent strong increases in house prices have"
contributed to robust growth in consumer credit (Technical Box 3).
There is a risk that these linkages could be stronger than assumed
or that house prices could continue to grow more rapidly than
"expected, resulting in higher-than-projected household spending"
"and, hence, greater upward pressures on inflation."
The main downside risk is
that the U.S. economy
could slow more sharply.
The main downside risk to the Canadian economy relates to
the possibility of a sharper slowdown in the housing sector in the
United States and a broadening of the weakness in the housing
sector to consumption and investment. A larger decline in domes-
tic demand in the United States would lead to decreased demand
for Canadian exports and broader weakness in the Canadian econ-
omy. This development would lead to lower inflation than in the
base-case projection.
"Related to these main risks, there are a number of other risks"
"to the base-case projection, two of which are described below."
An upside risk relates to sectoral and regional capacity pres-
"sures arising from the price boom in several commodities, which"
are being most intensely felt in Western Canada (especially in
Alberta).
These
pressures
have
led
to
considerable
upward
momentum in labour costs in that region. There is a risk that
prices and wages could increase even more rapidly in Western
Canada or that the transmission of inflationary pressures from
there to the rest of the country could be stronger.
A downside risk relates to the effects of the projected slowing
"in U.S. economic growth on the rest of the world, particularly in"
those emerging economies that are currently experiencing very
strong growth. To the extent that business investment in these
countries is being undertaken to meet prospective consumer
"demand in the United States, domestic demand growth in these"
countries may not be sufficient to offset the projected weaker U.S.
demand. A greater-than-expected slowing in the global economy
would likely result in weaker commodity prices and a weaker pro-
"file for Canadian exports over the projection period, thus putting"
downward pressure on Canadian inflation.

Technical Box 3
"Linkages between House Prices, Credit, and Household Spending"
"By increasing home equity and thus expanding the availability of collateral, the"
recent strong increases in house prices have contributed to robust growth in consumer
"credit. This, in turn, has significantly supported household spending."
"Resale house prices in Canada have been very strong since 2001, growing by an"
"annual average of 4.4 per cent, in real terms, compared with an average of -1.5 per cent"
"over the 1990s.1 From the beginning of 2005 to the end of June 2006, the cumulative rate"
of increase in real house prices has been 10.7 per cent on a national basis. This reflects
"much faster growth in Alberta and British Columbia, together with growth of over 5 per"
cent in the rest of the country over the same period.
The pickup in consumer credit growth coincided with the strong gains in house
"prices. Growth is particularly strong for personal lines of credit (PLCs), which are often"
"secured by home equity, averaging about 15 per cent in real terms in 2006. So far in"
"2006, PLCs have grown faster in Alberta and British Columbia than in the rest of the"
"country. While many factors, such as income and population growth, have contributed"
"to this faster growth in credit, the rapid rise in house prices has been a significant factor."
"Since 2001, household spending has remained robust as house prices and consumer"
credit have shown strong increases. While it is difficult to quantify the links from house
"prices to credit and spending, useful information can be gained by assessing the contri-"
"bution of PLCs to increased spending, since PLCs are the type of consumer credit most"
directly linked to house prices.2 Industry reports and survey data suggest that a signifi-
cant amount of PLCs are used to finance consumption. This link provides evidence that
the recent rise in house prices has contributed to the strong growth in consumer credit
and household spending.
"So far in 2006, house prices have grown much more than anticipated by market"
"observers, particularly in Alberta and British Columbia. As well, growth in consumer"
"credit and PLCs has remained strong, and Canadian households are generally in good"
financial health. While strength in household spending related to these factors is built
"into the base-case scenario, there is a risk that the linkages could be stronger than"
"assumed or that house prices could continue to grow rapidly, particularly in Alberta and"
"British Columbia, resulting in even higher household spending."
1.
Data for resale house prices are from Royal LePage and are deﬂated by the total CPI.
2.
"Since 2001, the share of PLCs in consumer credit has increased to over 50 per cent. Although"
"some of the PLCs represent a substitution from other types of loans, higher house prices have also con-"
tributed to a net increase in total consumer credit. Contributions to spending from mortgage refinanc-
"ing, which are linked to higher house prices, are not included here because of data limitations."

"Overall, risks are judged"
to be roughly balanced.
"Overall, the Bank judges that the risks relative to its projection"
for inflation are roughly balanced.
"The correction in global imbalances is unfolding in a benign,"
"albeit slow, manner. However, in the absence of further appropri-"
"ate policy actions, there remains a possibility of a disorderly reso-"
"lution of these imbalances. Consequently, the balance of risks for"
global and Canadian growth is tilted slightly to the downside late
in the projection period.
