MONETARY POLICY REPORT
UPDATE
– January 2005 –
This text is a commentary of the Governing Council of the Bank of Canada.
It presents the Bank’s updated outlook based on information
received up to 25 January 2005.
The adjustment of the Canadian econo-
my to major global developments continues
to shape the economic outlook. These de-
velopments include solid world economic
"growth; a realignment of world currencies,"
including the Canadian dollar; movements
in the prices of crude oil and non-energy
commodities; and the growing global pres-
ence of China and India. Canadian mone-
tary
policy
facilitates
the
adjustment
process by aiming to keep inflation at its
2 per cent target and the economy operat-
ing near its production capacity.
The near-term outlook for the global
economy is a touch weaker than projected
"in the October Monetary Policy Report, but"
there is now greater confidence in the mo-
mentum of the U.S. economy in 2005.
The Canadian economy is expected to
have been marginally weaker in the fourth
quarter of 2004 than projected in the last Re-
"port, owing partly to a somewhat more pro-"
nounced adjustment to the past apprecia-
"tion of the Canadian dollar. As well, since"
"October, the dollar has traded in a higher"
range than it had prior to the October Report.
Largely reflecting the dampening effects
on aggregate demand of the recent appreci-
"ation of the Canadian dollar, the economy"
is expected to operate a little further below
its full production capacity in 2005 than
was anticipated at the time of the last
"Report. For 2006, growth is projected to pick"
"up to slightly more than 3 per cent, consist-"
ent with returning the economy to its pro-
duction capacity in the second half of the
"year, and returning core inflation to the"
2 per cent target around the end of 2006.
"In line with this revised outlook, the"
pace of reduction in monetary stimulus is
likely to be slower than envisioned in the
Highlights
• The economy is expected to operate a
little further below its production capacity
in 2005 than was anticipated at the time of
the October Monetary Policy Report.
• The pace of reduction in monetary
stimulus is likely to be slower than
envisioned in the October Report.
• Growth is expected to pick up to slightly
more than 3 per cent in 2006.
• With the economy moving back to its
production capacity in the second half of
"2006, core inﬂation should return to the"
2 per cent target around the end of 2006.
• There are both upside and downside risks
"around the outlook, which continue to"
relate to the adjustment to global
developments.

"October Report. Against this background,"
the Bank left its target for the overnight rate
unchanged
in
December
and
January
(Chart 1).
This outlook is subject to both upside
and downside risks and to uncertainties.
While the near-term risks surrounding the
"global economic outlook have lessened,"
there are still significant medium-term
"risks related to the evolution of oil prices,"
"the pace of expansion in China, the way in"
which current account balances in the Unit-
"ed States and East Asia will be resolved,"
and geopolitical developments.
Uncertainties with respect to the Cana-
dian outlook continue to relate to the ongo-
ing adjustments to changes in the global
"economy, including changes in the ex-"
change rate. Understanding the reasons be-
"hind exchange rate movements is crucial,"
because they may have different implications
for aggregate demand and thus for mone-
tary policy (Box p. 3).
Recent Economic
Developments
Canada’s real GDP advanced at an annual
rate of 3.2 per cent in the third quarter of
"2004 (Chart 2), supported by a rise in final"
"domestic demand (Chart 3). Exports, how-"
"ever, were considerably weaker than expect-"
"ed, contributing to a larger-than-anticipated"
buildup of inventories. Economic growth is

expected to have slowed to about 2 1/4 per
cent in the fourth quarter of 2004 as firms be-
gan to correct this buildup.
Growth for the second half of 2004 is thus
estimated to have been around 2 3/4 per
cent—slightly lower than projected in the
October Report. This is also marginally be-
low the Bank’s estimate of growth in the
economy’s production potential.
Although considerable uncertainty is
associated with any estimate of the output
"gap, the Bank judges that the economy is"
"operating slightly below its capacity limits,"
consistent with its conventional measure of
the output gap (Chart 4). This judgment is
also broadly consistent with the response of
firms to the question on capacity pressures in
the Bank’s latest Business Outlook Survey. Some
"indicators, however, point to more slack."

Monetary Policy and Exchange Rate Movements
"Over the past two years, the Canadian dollar has appreciated by about 25 per"
"cent relative to the U.S. dollar, from an average of 65 cents U.S. in January 2003 to an"
average of 82 cents U.S. in January 2005.
Understanding the causes of exchange rate movements is important because the
implications for the Canadian economy of a change in the exchange rate depend cru-
"cially on the cause of the change, and may therefore require a different monetary pol-"
"icy response. From the standpoint of monetary policy, these causes can be divided"
into two broad types: those that stem from changes in the demand for Canadian
"goods and services, and those that do not. Developments over the past two years"
provide a useful illustration of these two types of forces.
"The first type relates to the strengthening global economic recovery, which led"
to a substantial increase in world commodity prices and to strong foreign demand for
"Canadian products, especially raw materials. This development represented a di-"
rect increase in Canadian aggregate demand. The associated appreciation of the Ca-
nadian dollar dampened the increase in aggregate demand and helped to facilitate
the adjustment of the Canadian economy by encouraging a shift in activity to-
wards Canada’s commodity-exporting sector. To the extent that the dampening
"effect on aggregate demand exactly offsets the direct increase in demand, there"
would be no need for a policy response.
"The second type, inde-"
pendent of the demand for
"Canadian goods and services,"
relates to the general weaken-
ing of the U.S. dollar against
most major floating curren-
cies.
This
reflects
growing
concerns about a shortage of
"savings in the United States,"
partly related to the expand-
"ing U.S. fiscal deficit, and a"
"surplus of savings elsewhere,"
mainly in Asia. The associated
appreciation of the Canadian
dollar works to reduce foreign
demand for Canadian prod-
ucts. All other things being
"equal,"
this
would
require
monetary policy to be more
stimulative than it otherwise
would have been.
"Over the past two years, an important challenge for Canadian monetary policy"
has been to determine the relative importance of these two main forces on the Cana-
dian dollar and the net impact on Canadian aggregate demand. For the early part of
"this period, both forces were at play, although the stronger world demand and ris-"
ing commodity prices appeared to be producing most of the dollar’s momentum. In
"the past few months, however, the weakening U.S. dollar appears to have become the"
"relatively more important factor, especially against a background of broadly stable"
commodity prices.

"For instance, wage increases have remained"
"quite moderate and, on average, core infla-"
tion has been below the 2 per cent midpoint
"of the target range since mid-2003. In contrast,"
"other indicators, such as capacity utilization"
"in the non-farm, goods-producing sector,"
suggest greater pressure on capacity.
Core inflation remained near 1.5 per
centbetweenAugustandDecember(Chart 5).
Modest excess supply in the Canadian
economy through most of 2003 and in early
2004 contributed to keeping the core rate of
inflation slightly below longer-run expecta-
tions. Falling prices for many import-inten-
"sive goods, partly associated with the"
"appreciation of the Canadian dollar, also"
continued to put downward pressure on
core inflation in the second half of 2004.

"At the same time, the 12-month rate of"
increase in the total CPI averaged slightly
"more than 2 per cent, chiefly reflecting sub-"
stantial increases in the consumer prices of
gasoline and fuel oil from their levels a year
earlier.
Adjusting to Global Change
"In the first half of 2004, the global"
economic upswing contributed to a surpris-
ingly strong recovery in Canadian exports.
"As a result, despite the earlier appreciation"
"of the Canadian dollar, output rose sharply"
between December 2003 and August 2004
in a number of industries highly exposed to
international trade.
Canadian exports fell back in the third
"quarter of 2004, and output in sectors highly"
exposed to international competition de-
creased somewhat in September and Octo-
ber. The further increase in the Canadian
dollar since mid-2004 and some modera-
tion in the growth of global demand will
likely weigh more heavily on these indus-
tries through 2005.
There are clearer indications of adjust-
ment by Canadian firms to the past and re-
cent appreciation of the dollar. The Bank’s
"latest Business Outlook Survey, conducted"
between mid-November and mid-Decem-
"ber, showed a clear distinction between"
firms that have been adversely affected by
the appreciation of the Canadian dollar and
those that have not. While the latter have
become more optimistic about future sales
"prospects, the former—mostly manufac-"
"turers, exporters, and their suppliers—"
have become noticeably pessimistic.
The Survey indicates that many firms
are taking measures to improve productiv-
"ity and reduce costs, not only in response to"
"the dollar’s appreciation, but also because"
of increased competition from Asian sup-
pliers. A growing number of firms have
chosen to cut costs by increasing their
imports of inputs and finished goods
from Asia. Some firms are adjusting to
the appreciation by moving away from
MONETARY POLICY REPORT UPDATE: JANUARY 2005
5
low-profit products and markets towards
those yielding higher returns. Still others
are planning to increase their investment in
machinery and equipment. In contrast to
"previous surveys, these now include firms"
that report having been adversely affected
by the appreciation of the Canadian dollar.
Economic Prospects
World oil prices have eased since late
October. Current oil futures contracts sug-
gest that the West Texas Intermediate (WTI)
oil price will average around US$47 per
"barrel in the first half of 2005, before easing"
to about US$42 per barrel by the second
half of 2006 (see Table 2). This scenario for
oil prices is somewhat lower than that used
in the last Report and provides a more solid
base for prospective growth in the global
economy.
The appreciation of the euro and the
yen vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar will direct de-
mand away from Japan and the euro area
towards China and the United States. U.S.
economic growth will be underpinned by
robust business expenditures and sus-
tained consumer spending supported by
employment gains. The U.S. economy is
thus expected to grow by just under 4 per
cent in 2005 and 2006.
"In Canada, further strong growth of"
final domestic demand is expected to con-
tribute importantly to economic growth
this year and next (Table 1). Business in-
vestment is expected to increase substan-
tially as a result of continued global
economic expansion and the associated
"high level of commodity prices, favourable"
"financial conditions, and ongoing reduc-"
tions in the prices of imported machinery
and equipment. Further gains in real in-
comes should contribute to solid growth in
"consumer spending. However, given rapid"
"increases in recent years, housing invest-"
ment is not expected to contribute further
to growth in domestic demand.
This outlook assumes that spending by
all levels of government will increase
"broadly in line with revenues, as govern-"
ments continue to strive to maintain fiscal
balance.
While ongoing growth abroad implies
further gains in demand for Canadian ex-
"ports, these gains are expected to be more"
than offset by faster growth in imports. The
past and recent appreciation of the Canadian
dollar is expected to dampen export growth
and to boost imports over the projection pe-
"riod. However, the contribution of net ex-"
ports to GDP growth continues to be highly
uncertain. Analyzing the evolution of Can-
ada’s international trade volumes in terms
of the underlying fundamentals has been

"particularly difficult over the past two years,"
"owing to the volatility of trade data, their"
"susceptibility to revisions, and some puz-"
zling developments in the context of major
structural changes in the global economy. 1
The high level of oil prices assumed in
the October Report was expected to have a
small negative effect on Canadian aggre-
"gate demand in 2005, before the positive"
impact on capital spending and output by
energy-producing companies became evi-
dent in 2006. With the lower oil-price sce-
"nario assumed in this Update, the adverse"
short-term effects on growth coming from
the rise in oil and gas prices since late 2003
should be somewhat more muted.
The Bank’s base-case projection calls for
aggregate demand for Canadian goods and
"services to increase, on average over the pro-"
"jection period, just slightly faster than the"
3 per cent estimated growth rate of poten-
tial output. Given the effects of the past and
"recent appreciation of the Canadian dollar,"
the Bank projects real GDP growth to aver-
age a little less than 3 per cent in 2005 and a
"little more than 3 per cent in 2006, with a"
somewhat larger drag from net exports than
"projected in the October Report, but strong-"
er growth in domestic demand (Table 1).
This growth scenario implies some increase
in excess supply in 2005 and a return to pro-
duction potential in the second half of 2006.
The Outlook for Inﬂation
The core rate of inflation is projected to
average just above 1.5 per cent in the first
"half of 2005, before gradually rising to the"
2 per cent target around the end of 2006
(Table 2).
1.
"Monetary Policy Report, October 2004, Box 3, p. 27"
The projected slack in product and
labour markets is expected to keep core
inflation below longer-run expectations
through 2005 and most of 2006. With the
economy expected to move back to its pro-
duction potential in the second half of 2006
and with inflation expectations remaining
"well anchored, the core rate should rise"
gradually to 2 per cent over the projection
period. The past and recent appreciation of
the Canadian dollar is also expected to exert
a small amount of downward pressure on
the core rate during this period.
The outlook for the 12-month rate of in-
crease in the total CPI will continue to be im-
portantly affected by developments in the
market for crude oil. Based on the scenario
"embodied in oil price futures, total CPI in-"
flation is expected to remain just above
2 per cent in the first half of 2005 and then
to fall considerably in the second half of the
year before rising towards the core rate of
inflation through 2006.
