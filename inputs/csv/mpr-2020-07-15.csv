Canada’s Inﬂ
ation-Control Strategy1
Inﬂ
ation targeting and the economy
""

The Bank’s mandate is to conduct monetary policy to promote
the economic and f
nancial well-being of Canadians.
""

Canada’s experience with inf
ation targeting since 1991 has
shown that the best way to foster conf
dence in the value
"of money and to contribute to sustained economic growth,"
employment gains and improved living standards is by keeping
inf
"ation low, stable and predictable."
""

"In 2016, the Government and the Bank of Canada renewed"
Canada’s inf
ation-control target for a further f
"ve-year period,"
"ending December 31, 2021. The target, as measured by the"
"consumer price index (CPI), remains at the 2 percent midpoint"
of the control range of 1 to 3 percent.
The monetary policy instrument
""

The Bank carries out monetary policy through changes in the
target for the overnight rate of interest.2 These changes are
transmitted to the economy through their inf
uence on market
"interest rates, domestic asset prices and the exchange rate,"
which affect total demand for Canadian goods and services.
The balance between this demand and the economy’s
"production capacity is, over time, the primary determinant of"
inf
ation pressures in the economy.
""

Monetary policy actions take time—usually from six to eight
quarters—to work their way through the economy and have
their full effect on inf
"ation. For this reason, monetary policy"
must be forward-looking.
""

"Consistent with its commitment to clear, transparent"
"communications, the Bank regularly reports its perspective on"
the forces at work on the economy and their implications for
inf
ation. The Monetary Policy Report is a key element of this
approach. Policy decisions are typically announced on eight
"pre-set days during the year, and full updates of the Bank’s"
"outlook, including risks to the projection, are published four"
times per year in the Monetary Policy Report.
Inﬂ
ation targeting is symmetric and ﬂ
exible
""

Canada’s inf
"ation-targeting approach is symmetric, which"
means that the Bank is equally concerned about inf
ation rising
above or falling below the 2 percent target.
""

Canada’s inf
ation-targeting framework is f
"exible. Typically,"
the Bank seeks to return inf
ation to target over a horizon of six
"to eight quarters. However, the most appropriate horizon for"
returning inf
ation to target will vary depending on the nature
and persistence of the shocks buffeting the economy.
Monitoring inﬂ
ation
""

"In the short run, the prices of certain CPI components can be"
"particularly volatile. These components, as well as changes in"
"indirect taxes such as GST, can cause sizable f"
uctuations in
CPI.
""

"In setting monetary policy, the Bank seeks to look through"
such transitory movements in CPI inf
ation and focuses
on a set of “core” inf
ation measures that better ref
ect the
underlying trend of inf
"ation. In this sense, these measures"
act as an operational guide to help the Bank achieve the CPI
inf
ation target. They are not a replacement for CPI inf
ation.
""

The Bank’s three preferred measures of core inf
ation are CPI-
"trim, which excludes CPI components whose rates of change"
"in a given month are the most extreme; CPI-median, which"
corresponds to the price change located at the 50th percentile
(in terms of basket weight) of the distribution of price changes;
"and CPI-common, which uses a statistical procedure to track"
common price changes across categories in the CPI basket.

"ation-Control Target (October 24, 2016) and Renewal of the"
Inf
"ation-Control Target: Background Information—October 2016, which are both available on the Bank’s website."
"2 When interest rates are at very low levels, the Bank has at its disposal a suite of extraordinary policy measures that could be used to provide additional"
monetary
"stimulus and/or improve credit market conditions. The Framework for Conducting Monetary Policy at Low Interest Rates, available on the Bank’s website,"
describes these measures and the principles guiding their use.

Overview
Overview
The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a worldwide health-care emergency
as well as an economic calamity. Both are on a scale few have seen in
"their lifetime. The virus has spread broadly and rapidly, and to contain it,"
governments introduced public health measures that curtailed economic
"activity. The virus, combined with these necessary measures, has brought"
about the steepest and deepest economic decline since the Great
Depression. Virtually every aspect of the Canadian and global economies
"has been affected, causing widespread losses in jobs and business"
incomes.
"The course of the pandemic is inherently unknowable, and its evolution"
over time and across regions remains highly uncertain. New cases of
"the virus are now at very low levels in China, but many other emerging-"
market economies (EMEs) are now seeing their number of new cases
increase rapidly (Chart 1). Some advanced economies that were hard-hit
at the outset have slowed the rise in new cases and are reopening their
"economies. In the United States, infections have reached new highs."
"Globally, hundreds of thousands of lives have been lost."

BANK OF CANADA  •  Monetary Policy Report  •  July 2020
"In Canada, the number of new COVID-19 cases has fallen sharply from"
"its April high, and the economic recovery has begun in all provinces and"
"territories and across many sectors. Consequently, economic activity is"
picking up notably as measures to contain the virus are relaxed. This is a
welcome sign.
The Bank of Canada expects a sharp rebound in economic activity in the
"reopening phase of the recovery, followed by a more prolonged recuperation"
"phase, which will be uneven across regions and sectors (Figure 1). As a"
"result, Canada’s economic output will likely take some time to return to its"
pre-COVID-19 level. Many workers and businesses can expect to face an
extended period of difficulty.
A central scenario is provided rather than a projection
"The economic outlook is extremely uncertain, largely because of the"
"unpredictable course of the virus. Reflecting this, the July Monetary Policy"
Report provides a central scenario for the economy rather than the usual
economic projection.
The central scenario is informed by the Bank’s analysis and tries to balance
"the likelihood of better and worse scenarios, but it is highly conditional on"
"our assumptions about the virus. In particular, the central scenario assumes"
the following:
""
 there will not be a broad-based second wave of the pandemic in Canada
or globally;
""
 most large-scale containment measures will be gradually lifted; and
""
" the pandemic will have largely run its course by mid-2022, likely because"
of the widespread availability of a vaccine or effective treatment.
"In addition to the fundamental uncertainty about the course of the virus,"
"there is also considerable uncertainty about its impacts. In particular, there"
is not enough information to estimate how deeply the economy may be
"scarred from business closures or massive job losses. Further, once supply"
"is restored, it is unclear how quickly demand will recover because people"
"may have changed their priorities, work patterns and social behaviours as a"
result of the pandemic.

BANK OF CANADA  •  Monetary Policy Report  •  July 2020
The Bank departed from the usual structure for the Monetary Policy Report
"in April by not including a base-case projection. For this July Report,"
the Bank moves in the direction of the traditional format by providing a
"central scenario, but given the unusual level of uncertainty, the information"
"provided is somewhat less precise. For example, Table 1 and Table 2 in this"
Report are based on the Bank’s central scenario. Less detail is provided
on the breakdown of the projection for global economic growth and on
the compositional contributions to the growth of Canada’s gross domestic
product (GDP).

Global economy
Global economy
"After a historic plunge in the first half of the year, global economic activity"
is beginning to pick up. The increase in global demand has contributed to
a partial rebound in the prices of commodities and some financial assets.
The decisive actions taken by many governments and central banks have
put households and businesses in a position to resume spending and
production as containment measures are relaxed. But there is significant
"ground to make up, and regional flare-ups of the virus could impede the"
recovery.
"In the Bank’s central scenario, global output rebounds in the second half of"
"this year, although the timing and strength of the recovery vary considerably"
from one region to another. The effects of both ongoing physical distancing
and elevated uncertainty are assumed to continue to restrain economic
activity over the scenario’s time horizon. Global output falls by about
5 percent in 2020 and then grows by around 5 percent on average in
"2021 and 2022 (Table 1). Despite this strong rebound, global output at"
the end of 2022 remains about 4 percent below the projected level in the
January Report.

Uncertainty around this scenario is considerable. There are a multitude of
scenarios both stronger and weaker than the central one presented here.
"Yet overall, the risks appear to be tilted to the downside, largely because of"
the potential for a second wave of the virus.
The global economic contraction was sharp and sudden
Measures to control the spread of COVID‑19 forced many businesses to
"reduce or halt their operations, resulting in unprecedented job losses."
"Global supply chains were disrupted, and global trade fell sharply. The"
"containment measures affected mainly labour-intensive activity, resulting"
"in a sharper decline in services than in manufacturing. In addition, the"
pandemic and containment measures were accompanied by an abrupt
deterioration in business and household confidence and significant changes
in behaviour. The Bank estimates that the level of global GDP in the second
quarter was about 10 percent below its level in the fourth quarter of 2019.
Inflation also fell in all major economies (Chart 2). Prices of gasoline
dropped sharply in March and April before partially rebounding in May. The
plunge in energy prices reflected the rapid and large fall in global demand.
Lower prices for transportation services and at hotels and restaurants also
"contributed to weak inflation in most regions. In contrast, food prices rose"
"at a faster pace than usual. Overall, the inflationary pressures from supply"
disruptions were outweighed by the effects of the fall in demand.

Growth is picking up as economies reopen
China was the first major country to allow some businesses to restart their
"operations, with strict infection prevention and control measures in place"
to rein in any new outbreaks. China’s industrial production has rebounded
"strongly, returning to pre-lockdown levels (Chart 3). Demand indicators"
"such as retail sales, however, have risen less than production as consumers"
"remain cautious. As well, manufacturing investment is sluggish, suggesting"
"that businesses are still uncertain about the strength of future demand,"
given the pandemic and ongoing trade tensions with the United States.
Economic conditions vary considerably across other EMEs. Some East
Asian countries have managed to keep the number of COVID‑19 cases low
and their economies mostly open. Some emerging European countries that
had put lockdowns in place have recently allowed businesses to reopen.
"Meanwhile, many Latin American and African EMEs are still experiencing"
"the first wave of the pandemic, at great human cost. These countries are"
"struggling to contain the virus, which may prolong the negative economic"
"effects and delay their recoveries. This, coupled with high levels of debt, is"
raising financial stability concerns in some EMEs.
"In many advanced economies, activity picked up in May and June. Surveys"
"indicated an increase in activity and confidence in the euro area. Production,"
"employment and household spending also increased in the United States,"
but the resurgence in new COVID‑19 cases since the middle of June is
slowing the rebound as many states are scaling back their reopening plans.

BANK OF CANADA  •  Monetary Policy Report  •  July 2020
Demand is expected to remain weak relative to supply
"In the second half of this year, the pace of global growth rebounds strongly"
"in the central scenario. The recovery then slows in 2021 and 2022, but"
"growth is still relatively strong. In the central scenario, the level of economic"
activity reaches its pre-COVID‑19 level around the end of 2021. While the
"impact of the pandemic is negative for both supply and demand, the effects"
on demand are larger.
"On the supply side, production practices in some sectors will need to"
adjust to include physical distancing measures. As companies evaluate the
"vulnerability of cross-border trade, supply chains could become shorter,"
more local and possibly more diversified after the pandemic. On the
"demand side, even when lockdown restrictions relax fully, precautionary"
physical distancing will likely continue to restrain household spending. In
"addition, elevated indebtedness and economic uncertainty are expected to"
cause some businesses to scale back or cancel large investment projects.
Policy actions continue to provide support
Authorities in many countries were able to quickly implement extraordinary
measures to support household incomes and limit the economic damage
related to the shutdown. These actions will support the recovery as activity
resumes.
"Governments in advanced economies and some large EMEs, such as China"
"and Brazil, have significantly increased resources to fight the pandemic and"
soften its economic blow. These resources include transfers to households
and businesses to replace a portion of their lost income. Many countries
have also implemented loan guarantees and direct funding programs to help
businesses facing liquidity shortages. Authorities in some of these countries
"are considering additional fiscal support. In many other EMEs, fiscal support"
has generally been more modest due to already elevated debt levels.
Central banks around the world have taken decisive measures to stabilize
the financial system and support credit flows to businesses and households.
These include measures to ease short-term funding strains and to improve
liquidity. Major central banks have reduced their policy rates or eased
"through other measures. In the United States, the US Federal Reserve"
"lowered the federal funds rate, significantly increased its purchase of US"
Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities and introduced a series of other
"programs to support the flow of credit. In addition, it extended its network"
of US-dollar swap arrangements in response to the increased stress in the
offshore US dollar market.
Global financial conditions have improved substantially since the April
"Report, and this is helping support the recovery. Markets have reacted"
"positively to the fiscal and monetary measures, the pickup in global demand"
"and signs of receding negative tail risks. Since the April Report, equity"
"prices have recovered a significant portion of their losses, credit spreads"
"have narrowed, and volatility has declined across all markets (Chart 4)."
"Financial market indicators for EMEs have also generally improved, although"
"by less in hard-hit economies such as Brazil, South Africa and Mexico,"
where the pandemic is still spreading rapidly.

BANK OF CANADA  •  Monetary Policy Report  •  July 2020
The US dollar has depreciated somewhat against major currencies
"since April, including the Canadian dollar. Safe-haven flows into assets"
"denominated in US dollars declined, and some flows reverted to assets"
denominated in other currencies. The increase in commodity prices has
also supported the Canadian dollar. Government bond yields in advanced
economies remain close to their historical lows due to central bank asset
purchases and financial market expectations that central banks will keep
their policy rates low for an extended period.
Commodity prices have partially rebounded
Global oil prices have increased since the April Report but remain about
30 percent below pre-pandemic levels. The recent rise reflects both an
increase in global oil consumption as economies reopen and reduced
production (Chart 5). Low oil prices led members of the Organization of
the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and some other non-OPEC oil
producers to agree to reduce output by 9.7 million barrels per day compared
with their October 2018 levels.1 North American producers also cut output
by about 4 million barrels per day.
"In its central scenario, the Bank assumes that the prices of Brent and West"
"Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil will remain close to their recent average levels,"
about US$40 per barrel. Risks around this assumption are tilted to the
upside over the medium term because prices could continue to increase as
global growth recovers and oil consumption picks up.
1	 This corresponds roughly to a production cut of 8 million barrels per day relative to their March 2020
levels.

The price of Western Canadian Select (WCS) has also risen and was
recently hovering around US$30 per barrel. The spread between the prices
"of WTI and WCS has narrowed to about US$10, due in part to the cuts in"
"Canadian output. Moreover, the decline in demand was more pronounced"
"for light oil such as WTI, which is used more in jet fuel and gasoline, than for"
heavy oils such as WCS.
The Bank’s non-energy commodity price index has recovered its decline
from February to April. The rise in the price of base metals is consistent
with the gradual recovery in industrial production and the increases in
infrastructure spending in China and some advanced economies. Prices for
"lumber have risen, reflecting the closures of sawmills due to COVID‑19."

Canadian economy
The Canadian economy is starting to recover from the tragic and
devastating effects of the pandemic. The human and economic costs would
be considerably worse if the containment measures had not succeeded in
"flattening the curve. In the second quarter, when containment measures"
"were at their most restrictive, economic activity is estimated to have fallen"
about 15 percent below its level at the end of 2019. The economy appears to
"have hit bottom in April, with about 3 million jobs lost."
The economic contraction and subsequent recovery will look very different
from those of a typical business cycle. The impact of the containment
measures varied substantially across industries and types of jobs. Some
jobs continued with little disruption because of the availability of online
"tools and the ability to work remotely. Others were hit very hard, particularly"
"within the service sector, including jobs in travel, hospitality and personal"
"care services. In addition, the burden has been falling disproportionately on"
"some segments of the workforce, including lower-income earners, younger"
"workers, recent immigrants and women (Chart 6)."

BANK OF CANADA  •  Monetary Policy Report  •  July 2020
"The strong, well-targeted and complementary fiscal and monetary policy"
"actions provide a solid foundation for the recovery. Still, as reopening"
"progresses, many people will probably continue to fear contracting the"
"virus, and uncertainty about job security is likely to persist. Both consumer"
"and business confidence are therefore expected to remain subdued,"
"restraining spending and employment, particularly in activities that involve"
"in-person interaction. In addition, the pandemic has led to changes in"
"preferences and behaviours. Some of these shifts are expected to endure,"
with lasting effects that could lead to structural changes in the economy
over the longer term.
"Despite the significant hardships that Canadians continue to face, the"
economy has so far avoided the most severe scenarios presented in the
April Report. There are already signs that the reopening of businesses
will lead to an initial strong bounce back in economic growth (Table 2).
"However, this is expected to give way to a recuperation phase during which"
the pace of the recovery will moderate as the pandemic continues to affect
"confidence and the economy undergoes widespread adjustments, including"
in the energy sector. Consumer price index (CPI) inflation is expected to
"remain weak before gradually strengthening toward the 2 percent target, as"
the drag from low gasoline prices and other temporary effects dissipate and
"demand recovers, reducing economic slack (Box 1)."
Box 1
Key inputs to the central scenario
The Bank’s central scenario is conditional on several key
assumptions that aﬀ
ect the outlook for the Canadian
economy . In addition to the assumptions about the
progression of the pandemic and public health measures
"described in the Overview section, the key inputs into the"
Bank’s central scenario are as follows:
• Oil prices are assumed to remain near recent levels .
The per-barrel prices in US dollars are assumed to be
$40 for Brent and West Texas Intermediate and $30 for
Western Canadian Select .
"• By convention, the Bank does not forecast the exchange"
"rate in the Monetary Policy Report . In the central scenario,"
the Canadian dollar is assumed to remain close to recent
"levels, at about 74 cents US ."
• The neutral nominal policy rate is deﬁ
ned as the real
rate consistent with output remaining sustainably at
its potential and with infl
"ation at target, on an ongoing"
"basis, plus 2 percent for infl"
ation . It is a medium- to long-
term equilibrium concept . The central scenario assumes
"the neutral rate is 2 .5 percent, in the lower half of the"
previously estimated range . The neutral rate will be
reassessed more fully in the October Report .
• The pandemic and the related containment measures
are signiﬁ
cantly aﬀ
ecting both supply and demand in
"the Canadian economy . In the central scenario, the Bank"
assumes that the impact on supply in the ﬁ
rst half of
2020 is roughly 60 percent of the size of the impact on
GDP . The level of output is estimated to have fallen to
about 15 percent below its level in the fourth quarter
of 2019 . This would imply a gap between demand and
supply of roughly 6 to 7 percent in the second quarter .
• The degree of uncertainty around these estimates is
unusually high due to the extraordinary nature and
size of the ec
onomic shocks caused by COVID-19 .
For additional details about the Bank’s assumptions
"for supply and potential output in the central scenario,"
see Box 3 on page 24 . The Bank will provide a more
detailed analysis of its long-run assumptions in the
October Report .

Fiscal and monetary authorities responded swiftly
The labour market impact of the containment measures has been severe.
"Between February and April, some 3 million people were suddenly out of"
"work. In May, the unemployment rate reached a peak of 13.7 percent. An"
additional 1.4 million people reported that they wanted to work but did
"not look for a job, suggesting an adjusted unemployment rate of nearly"
"20 percent. Broader measures of underemployment, which include people"
"who were employed but worked less than half their usual hours, suggest"
that roughly one-third of the labour force was underutilized.
The federal government quickly launched unprecedented fiscal policy
actions to help households and businesses during the lockdown. Policies
were introduced to replace lost income and encourage businesses to retain
workers.2 The Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) and other
"transfers have offset lost employment income for many workers. In addition,"
the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (CEWS) has helped businesses
maintain relationships with their workers and should reduce longer-term
scarring effects of unemployment on the economy. Nearly one-quarter of
the respondents to the Bank’s summer Business Outlook Survey reported
that this subsidy had enabled them to either avoid or reduce the scale of
potential layoffs.
Businesses also have access to loans through federal programs. The
Canada Emergency Business Account in particular has been widely used.
"It provides up to $40,000 in funding to existing small businesses and will"
"forgive up to $10,000 if the loan is repaid before the end of 2022."
"In addition, federal, provincial and territorial governments have granted"
"deferrals on more than $123 billion in taxes, fees and customs duties."
"While temporary, these measures have been an important source of relief"
for many businesses and households facing cash-flow pressures. As
"well, commercial lenders implemented processes for households to defer"
mortgage and other debt payments.
The Bank also responded swiftly to the effects of the pandemic. Starting
"in late February, uncertainty about how bad things could get and how long"
the downturn might last prompted a widespread flight to cash and made it
difficult for investors to sell assets. In response to the seizing up in financial
"markets and the economic contraction, the Bank rapidly reduced the policy"
interest rate to its effective lower bound of 0.25 percent and introduced
a range of liquidity facilities and asset purchase programs to help ease

problems with market functioning. These programs include purchases
"of Canada Mortgage Bonds, bankers’ acceptances, commercial paper,"
corporate bonds and provincial and federal government debt.
"Financial markets are now functioning considerably better and,"
"consequently, the use of some facilities has declined (Chart 7). The Bank’s"
large-scale asset purchases of Government of Canada bonds initially
"improved liquidity and confidence. Now, with market functioning improved"
"and the economy reopening, these purchases are providing considerable"
monetary stimulus. The lowering of the policy interest rate to its effective
"lower bound, the bond purchases and the easing of global financial"
conditions have all contributed to lower domestic interest rates and made
"it easier for households and businesses to borrow. For example, the lower"
yields on five-year Government of Canada bonds are being reflected in
cheaper fixed-rate mortgages. These actions have reduced debt-service
costs and will contribute to spending that should support the recovery.
The reopening phase of the recovery is underway
GDP is estimated to have contracted sharply in the second quarter (Table 2
and Chart 8). Timely high-frequency data suggest that the economic fallout
"was at its worst in April. In May and June, as the number of new COVID‑19"
"cases stabilized and began to decrease, governments started easing the"
containment restrictions. Labour market indicators suggest that economic
activity began expanding in May and accelerated in June. About 1
1/4 million
"jobs were added in these two months, with broad-based, but uneven,"
increases across sectors (Chart 9).

These developments are consistent with measures of consumer and
"business confidence, which have improved but remain subdued (Chart 10)."
"Despite the programs that have been introduced, some households and"
businesses are suffering severe financial hardship.
"In the central scenario, about 40 percent of the drop in output in the first"
half of 2020 is reversed in the third quarter. This reflects the lifting of most
containment measures and some associated improvement in confidence.
The strength of growth in the third quarter is largely driven by the initial
boost from the reopening of businesses and the resulting partial rebound
"in spending. The pace of growth is therefore unlikely to persist. Overall, the"
economy has thus far avoided the most severe scenarios presented in the
"April Report, but considerable economic slack remains."
CPI inflation has fallen sharply
Demand for some goods and services has fallen sharply because of the
"pandemic and related containment measures, triggering sharp declines"
"in prices for gasoline, travel services, and clothing and footwear. In the"
"calculation of inflation, these price declines have heavily outweighed"
"the increase in prices for products that saw a surge in demand, such as"
"household cleaning supplies and non-perishable food, or that suffered from"
"supply disruptions, such as meat (Chart 11)."
The direct and indirect effects of the crisis have been pulling down CPI
"inflation. As anticipated in the April Report, CPI inflation fell close to zero in"
"April and May. The Bank’s measures of core inflation have also declined,"
although by far less because they tend to filter out more volatile price
movements such as those for gasoline. Core inflation measures ranged from
1.4 to 1.9 percent (Chart 12).

The consumption patterns of Canadians have changed dramatically since
the start of the pandemic. CPI inflation is calculated using fixed pre-
pandemic consumption weights and thus may not accurately capture the
inflation rate households are currently facing. Box 2 outlines a new adjusted
price index that captures the effects of the change in consumption patterns.
The new price index is based on recent monthly transaction and survey
"data. It also shows a sizable decline in inflation, albeit one that is slightly"
smaller than in the official CPI (Chart 12).3

Box 2
Adjusted CPI infl
ation shows only slightly less decline than CPI infl
ation
"Abrupt, large shifts in consumer spending occurred with"
the onset of the pandemic . These shifts imply that the
"consumer price index (CPI), which is a ﬁ"
xed basket of
"goods and services, may not refl"
ect the actual level of
infl
ation Canadians experienced during the containment
period . The responses to the Bank of Canada’s most recent
Canadian Survey of Consumer Expectations illustrate this
"potential discrepancy . Respondents indicated that, in their"
"experience, year-over-year infl"
ation had remained close
"to 2 percent in the second quarter of 2020 . However, in"
"fact, infl"
ation as measured by the CPI is estimated to have
declined sharply .1
To better understand consumers’ current infl
ation
"experiences, the Bank and Statistics Canada developed"
"an adjusted price index, also referred to as the Analytical"
price index . This index updates weights based on high-
"frequency expenditure data, adjusting them to shifts in"
consumption patterns .2 New monthly weights are calculated
"using anonymized aggregated payment data, Statistics"
"Canada’s monthly retail trade survey, and transaction data"
from Canadian grocery retailers as well as subject matter
expertise .3
The new index shows how much consumption patterns
"have changed . For instance, the adjusted weights for food,"
medicine and other pharmaceutical products (health and
"personal care) are higher than in the CPI . In contrast, the"
"weights for transportation (travel, motor vehicles), clothing"
and recreation are signiﬁ
cantly lower than CPI weights
(Table 2-A) .
"Overall, this adjusted index suggests slightly less"
downward pressure on infl
"ation than CPI does, by about"
0 .3 percentage points in May (Chart 12) .4 These results

"For more details, see the most recent Canadian Survey of Consumer Expectations ."

Actual CPI weights are based on Statistics Canada’s 2017 Survey of Household
Expenditures .

"For more details, see T . Mitchell, G . O’Donnell, R . Taves, Z . Weselake-George and"
"A . Xu, “Consumer Expenditures During COVID-19: An Exploratory Analysis of the"
Eﬀ
"ects of Changing Consumption Patterns on Consumer Price Indexes,”  Statistics"
Canada Prices Analytical Series No . 2020010 (July 2020) .
4 The diﬀ
erences between the adjusted measure and the CPI apply to only 3 months
(March through May 2020) out of the 12 used to calculate CPI infl
ation on a year-
"over-year basis . Before March 2020, the adjusted measure assumes that spending"
"patterns, and thus"
"monthly growth rates, are the same as those measured by CPI ."
show that although consumption patterns shifted through
the containment period (and by quite a bit in areas such as
"travel services), shifts in the weights did not have a large"
impact on overall infl
"ation .5 Thus, both the adjusted index and"
the CPI indicate that the impacts of COVID-19 containment
measures and behavioural changes have been strongly
disinfl
ationary .
Statistics Canada and the Bank will c
ontinue to update this
new index to calculate an adjusted CPI infl
ation measure
through the recovery period . The diﬀ
erence between the
two measures of infl
ation may dissipate if the changes in
consumption patterns reverse .
5
Consumer perceptions of price changes may suggest a bigger diﬀ
erence
because they are more likely to be infl
"uenced by items purchased frequently,"
like food . The prices of these frequently purchased items have risen during the
containment period .

BANK OF CANADA  •  Monetary Policy Report  •  July 2020
Firms have been heavily discounting some products to clear out undesired
"inventories that built up at the height of the pandemic. At the same time,"
there is only limited evidence to date of firms marking up their prices to
cover the increased costs of doing business during the pandemic. Despite
"these additional costs, respondents to the summer Business Outlook"
Survey stated that they intend to raise prices less than last year and operate
with smaller margins to remain competitive. Combined with low energy
"prices, these forces are expected to keep inflation weak in the near term."
Growth moderates in the recuperation phase
"After the initial bounce back in GDP growth, the economy is expected"
to enter a more protracted and gradual recovery (Chart 13). This reflects
"persistent effects of ongoing physical distancing measures, a slow rebound"
in foreign demand and subdued confidence on the part of households and
firms resulting from elevated uncertainty about both the pandemic and the
pace of the recovery.
Ongoing restructuring is an additional factor that restrains activity during
"recuperation. Some businesses will not reopen, others will go bankrupt,"
and new firms will require more time to form and scale. The service
"sector is usually more resilient in recessions, providing a buffering role"
"for the economy. This time, however, the sector was also hit hard during"
containment and will face ongoing challenges adjusting to a world where
physical distancing remains necessary.

"In the central scenario, fiscal and monetary policies together provide"
substantial support to the Canadian economy. Fiscal measures are
scaled to the impacts of the pandemic and respond to evolving economic
"conditions. Since the April Report, the CERB and CEWS have both been"
"extended. Moreover, other programs have been introduced or expanded,"
including commercial rent assistance and additional supports for students
"and new graduates, seniors, essential workers, and the oil and gas sector.4"
Monetary stimulus has reduced borrowing costs for both households and
businesses.
Several forces contribute to closing the gap between supply and demand
over time in the central scenario. Supply initially recovers in line with the
easing of containment measures. Demand benefits only gradually from
improvements in foreign demand and confidence as well as support from
"fiscal and monetary policies, but eventually foreign and domestic demand"
"increase faster than supply, absorbing excess capacity."
"Household spending will rise, but caution may linger"
"In the central scenario, household spending picks up gradually as"
containment measures are eventually lifted and confidence in the economy
"improves. However, caution persists. Thus, while the savings rate declines"
"from its peak in the second quarter, it remains higher than in recent years"
(Chart 14).5
"4	 For more details, see the Government of Canada website."
5	 The large jump in the savings rate in the second quarter reflects the combined impact of the income
support payments and the income tax deferrals on disposable income as well as the constrained
spending due to the containment measures. The effects on disposable income are expected to unwind
in the third quarter.

"Underlying the central scenario, the consumption patterns of households"
differ greatly depending on households’ individual financial situations and
the impact of the pandemic on their incomes.6 Lower-income workers have
been disproportionately affected by the efforts to contain the spread of the
"virus, either through layoffs or reduced hours. Many have seen their lost"
incomes replaced by CERB payments or other income-support measures
"and have benefited temporarily from deferred debt payments. Nonetheless,"
"some of these households will face prolonged income losses, which could"
"push up the number of financially stressed households, restraining the"
recovery of consumption.
"At the same time, the incomes of other households have held up through"
this period. They are more likely to include people who earn higher incomes
and who work in professions with few barriers to remote work. These
"households have been accumulating savings, mainly because there has"
been less to spend money on during the containment period. This suggests
pent-up demand could help boost spending of some consumers.
"Overall, the central scenario for consumption incorporates a degree of"
"caution, as some households prioritize paying down debts or increasing"
precautionary savings given the uncertain economic environment.
Insolvencies increase but do not derail the recovery.
"More broadly, household spending patterns have shifted since the onset of"
"the pandemic, and some of these changes may last (Chart 15). As a result,"
there is heightened uncertainty regarding the composition of consumption
and housing demand in the central scenario and what that might imply for
the retail and travel sectors as well as for residential construction.
"In the central scenario, the effects of the downturn and lower immigration"
hold down housing activity over the next few years. After a near-term boost
"from pent-up demand, residential investment slowly increases as income"
and confidence recover.

Business investment is likely to remain weak
"In the Bank’s central scenario, uncertainty about the composition and"
"strength of future demand, elevated debt levels and lingering financial"
stress significantly dampen business investment. Across all regions and
"sectors, respondents to the summer Business Outlook Survey reported that"
uncertainty is weighing heavily on investment plans and suggested that their
investment will remain weak over the next 12 months (Chart 16).
"Business investment recovers slowly in the central scenario, even as"
elevated uncertainty recedes. This reflects that capacity pressures are
quite limited overall and that some firms are scaling back or abandoning
"their investment plans, while other businesses are closing their doors"
"permanently. In addition, it will take some time for businesses to reposition"
themselves and adjust their investment to reflect new demand patterns.
A lower investment path is also likely to have persistent effects on potential
"output by reducing the future capital stock. One area of relative strength,"
"however, is investment in digital technology. The pandemic has already"
"accelerated digitalization in some sectors. In the Business Outlook Survey,"
"retailers often cited plans to further invest in online offerings, and providers"
of financial and other professional services reported spending more on
digital technology so that staff can work from home efficiently.
The energy sector is expected to remain subdued
The current environment of low energy prices arrived just as the sector was
beginning to emerge from a lengthy period of challenging adjustments.
Acute liquidity concerns have eased as oil prices have increased from
their April lows and the spread between the prices of WTI and WCS has
"narrowed. Nevertheless, the sector remains under pressure, with smaller"
"firms facing greater challenges than the larger, more-integrated producers."

"Restructuring within the industry, ongoing since the 2014–15 oil price shock,"
is expected to continue. Oil production has been reduced and capital
"expenditure plans have been significantly curtailed. In addition, there are"
renewed questions about the likelihood of pipelines being developed. The
"central scenario anticipates that, with weaker investment in the face of"
"reduced demand and low prices, oil production is now on a considerably"
lower path than before the COVID‑19 crisis.
Exports will recover at a moderate pace
"Exports in the central scenario recover gradually as borders reopen further,"
international supply chains are re-established and foreign demand picks up.
"However, travel and exports of motor vehicles and energy continue to weigh"
"on growth, given weaker demand for these products during the recuperation"
phase.
The current crisis could amplify pressures to relocate supply chains
"domestically, a global trend that started before the pandemic due to rising"
"protectionism. In addition, in the current environment of disrupted trade,"
some of the declines in exports may be offset by substitution away from
some imports and toward domestic goods and services.
A slow rebound in demand weighs on inflation
"In the central scenario, the path for CPI inflation over the next year largely"
reflects the influence of energy prices. The dramatic decline in these prices
in March and April will hold inflation down until early 2021 (Chart 17). After
"that, the inflation outlook depends primarily on the speed and strength at"
which demand and supply recover. Firms report that capacity could return
quickly as the economy reopens and containment measures are lifted. They
"expect the recovery in demand to be more muted, especially in the services"
and energy sectors (Chart 18). The scenario assumes that the impact on
supply is about 60 percent of the decline in GDP over the first half of 2020
(Box 3).

Box 3
Estimating the economy’s supply in the wake of COVID-19
The pandemic has had large and pervasive impacts on the
supply of goods and services in the Canadian economy . The
nature of the supply eﬀ
ects is very diﬀ
erent than in past
recessions . Supply fell dramatically when governments told
some ﬁ
rms to shut down their operations temporarily .
While certain sectors may continue to face restrictions for
"some time, many businesses are already reopening . Thus,"
much of the initial decline in supply is likely to be relatively
short-lived and therefore not as damaging to the economy’s
"underlying productive capacity (i .e ., potential output) as"
"it could have been . Intuitively, this productive capacity"
continues to exist and would have remained in use if not for
COVID-19 . This reasoning explains this Report’s distinction
between supply and potential output in the near term .
"Through the recuperation phase, the diﬀ"
erence between
"the concepts goes away . Thus, the longer-term outlook for"
supply becomes the new outlook for potential output . Over
"the longer term, both incorporate the persistent scarring"
eﬀ
ects of the pandemic on investment and the working-age
population .
The extraordinary nature of the COVID-19 pandemic
The Bank of Canada estimates that total supply was about
9 percent lower in the second quarter of 2020 than in
"the fourth quarter of 2019, largely due to the impact of"
containment measures . This sharp contraction in supply
amounts to about 60 percent of the decline in gross
domestic product (GDP) over the same period .
"In the Bank’s central scenario, the short-term contraction"
in supply is assumed to be attributable to hours lost due
to ﬁ
"rm shutdowns, stay-at-home orders, disruptions to"
"work routines, caring for relatives at home and, to a lesser"
"extent, sickness . These eﬀ"
ects are expected to dissipate
as containment measures are relaxed . Some eﬀ
ects are
anticipated to persist through the ﬁ
rst half of 2021 to account
for the pandemic and ongoing challenges in some industries .
"In addition, both consumer and business conﬁ"
dence have
been severely shaken by the pandemic and continuing
uncertainty about its course and economic impacts . Low
conﬁ
dence has negative eﬀ
ects on demand as well as on
"supply, and these eﬀ"
ects last well beyond the initial easing
"of containment measures . Overall, in the Bank’s central"
"scenario, demand takes longer than supply to recover in the"
near term .
A long-term perspective on potential output
The level of potential output by 2022 in the central scenario
is almost 4 percent lower than in the January Report
(Cha
"rt 3-A) . Population, business investment and labour"
productivity are all expected to follow lower trajectories .
"In the near term, fewer immigrants and international"
students are expected to come to Canada because of
travel restrictions and delays in processing new visas . As
"a result, the Canadian working-age population is expected"
to contract slightly through the middle of the year before
returning to growth at the end of 2020 . Looking further
"ahead, the Bank assumes that the pace of people arriving"
in Canada as permanent and non-permanent residents will
gradually return to its pre-COVID-19 rate by 2022 .
The current crisis is also assumed to have long-lasting
adverse eﬀ
ects on the productive capacity of the economy:
"changes in business and consumer behaviour, combined"
with bankruptcies and layoﬀ
"s, may lead to important"
structural adjustments . The reallocation of labour and
capital across sectors will likely result in some mismatches
"of skills and obsolescence of capital, which in turn could"
weigh on investment and labour productivity .
Demand falls more than supply in the central
scenario

"Even as establishments reopen, many consumers are expected to be"
"hesitant to resume their previous spending patterns, partly due to fears of"
"contracting the virus. In addition, even those who did not lose their job, or"
"those whose lost income was fully offset by government programs, may"
re-evaluate their need for precautionary savings. Foreign demand may be
even slower to rebound because some trade partners are taking longer than
Canada to contain the spread of the virus. Faced with uncertainty about
"demand, businesses are likely to cancel or postpone investment plans."
"Overall, this implies that demand will take some time to recover in line with"
supply.
"In this context, weak demand explains why firms are reluctant to pass along"
"cost increases associated with the pandemic. However, it is possible that"
customers will be sympathetic when price increases are clearly linked to
these costs. This could lead to higher inflation than in the central scenario.
"So far, consumer expectations of inflation over the next one to two years"
have remained firm despite the large decline in CPI inflation. In the central
"scenario, downward pressure on inflation gradually fades as demand"
"recovers and economic slack diminishes. However, uncertainty is far greater"
than usual. The large declines in both demand and supply are extraordinary.
"Over a longer horizon, the pandemic could cause large and lasting changes"
"in consumer preferences and other sources of demand. Similarly, the scope"
"of possible structural changes to a post-pandemic economy is vast, and"
the timing of adjustments will remain unknowable as long as COVID‑19
continues to be a threat.

The Bank of Canada responded quickly and forcefully to market disruptions
as well as to the anticipated economic consequences of the COVID‑19
pandemic and related containment measures. The Bank reduced the policy
"interest rate by 150 basis points to 25 basis points, its effective lower bound,"
and launched a number of liquidity facilities and asset purchase programs.
The cumulative impact of these facilities and purchase programs since
March has resulted in an exceptional increase in the size of the Bank’s
balance sheet (Chart 19a).
While the initial intent of the facilities and programs was to restore market
"functioning, the programs all play a role in the conduct of monetary policy."
"This is because, when markets are not functioning properly, the chain of"
"lending and borrowing stops working, and the ability of monetary policy to"
"provide stimulus breaks down. During a crisis, central banks must ensure"
that credit can continue to flow to households and businesses. Although the
Bank has reduced the frequency of its short-term liquidity operations since
"the improvement in market functioning, the facilities are still in place as an"
important backstop while uncertainty remains elevated.

BANK OF CANADA  •  Monetary Policy Report  •  July 2020
Large-scale secondary market purchases of Government of Canada bonds
provide monetary stimulus through several channels and can be described
"as quantitative easing (QE).7 When markets are not functioning well, QE"
improves liquidity in the government bond market (liquidity channel).
QE can also lower borrowing costs for businesses and households by
putting downward pressure on government yields (interest-rate channel).8
Through the purchase of a large quantity of government bonds held by the
"private sector, QE reduces the relative supply of bonds and thus lowers"
"their relative yields, leading investors to reallocate their portfolio to riskier"
"assets (portfolio balance channel). In addition, some investors will adjust"
"their portfolios to include more assets priced in other currencies, placing"
downward pressure on the Canadian dollar (foreign exchange channel).
Markets generally interpret QE as a signal that rates will likely be at the lower
bound for an extended period (signalling channel).9
The Bank has committed to continue buying at least $5 billion of Canadian
government bonds each week until the recovery is well underway. The
current level of purchases is likely working to varying degrees through all
"these channels, which helps make borrowing more accessible and more"
"affordable for households and businesses. Initially, the purchases were"
improving liquidity. With improved market functioning and the reopening
"of the economy, other channels are becoming more important. While the"
Bank’s balance sheet is not large compared with those of other major
"central banks, the increase in its size has been particularly rapid (Chart 19b)."
"The Bank’s corporate bond purchase program, through purchases of"
"corporate bonds in secondary markets, has helped improve liquidity"
"conditions in this market, even though purchases have been limited to"
"date. As market functioning improved globally and in Canada, Canadian"
corporations became better able to access markets directly for new
borrowing that will support continued operations. Credit easing programs
like this one can deliver stimulus by narrowing the difference between yields
"of corporate and government bonds, bringing down borrowing costs for"
businesses.

Alternative scenarios and risks
Alternative scenarios and risks
The central scenario for output and inflation described in this Report is highly
"conditional on the course of the pandemic, and there are many scenarios"
above and below this one in which the evolution of the pandemic is more or
less favourable. There are also a number of economic upside and downside
"risks even if the virus evolves as assumed in the central scenario. In practice,"
"public health and economic health are closely intertwined, with many of the"
economic risks likely to break to the upside (downside) if the virus evolves
more (less) favourably than in the central scenario.
"On the downside, there are a series of increasingly dire scenarios in"
"which COVID-19 outbreaks increase as the economy reopens, forcing the"
"reintroduction of containment measures. The broader the shutdowns, the"
bigger the economic impact. This includes the possibility of a widespread
"and possibly more severe second wave of the virus, requiring a complete"
lockdown.
"Tighter global financial conditions could result if, for instance, there were"
"widespread household, corporate and sovereign defaults given elevated"
debt levels. Such an outcome would threaten financial stability and likely
cause a rapid adjustment of market prices and risk premiums. Emerging
"markets, particularly those that have not yet contained the virus, would be"
especially vulnerable and could face greater stress and a marked increase
"in capital outflows. If the pandemic takes a more dire path, trade tensions"
"could be exacerbated, and global fragmentation could worsen. In Canada,"
a much weaker scenario could crystalize the risks associated with high
household indebtedness.
"On the upside, a stronger economic scenario could unfold if, for instance,"
"economies reopen with minimal spread of the virus, or if a vaccine or"
effective treatment is available earlier than assumed in the central scenario.
Such an improved scenario could lead to and in turn be bolstered by higher
commodity prices and greater business and consumer confidence. These
factors would likely lead to a stronger profile in exports and business
"investment, most notably in the energy and commodity sectors. If consumer"
"confidence were more robust and enduring, a stronger rebound in household"
spending than the subdued recovery in the central scenario would be
anticipated. A more positive outlook could prompt households that built up
savings during the containment period to pick up the spending they had put
"on hold, releasing pent-up demand."
"Even if the course of the pandemic is as assumed in the central scenario,"
the economic factors mentioned above could lead to stronger or weaker
"outcomes for the economic outlook, with dynamics similar to what is"
discussed here.
